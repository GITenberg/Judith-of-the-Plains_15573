<p class="tei tei-p">It was June, and a little past sunrise, but there
was no hint of early summer freshness in the
noxious air of the sleeping-car as it toiled like a snail
over the infinity of prairie. From behind the green-striped
curtains of the berths, now the sound of
restless turning and now a long-drawn sigh signified
the uneasy slumber due to stifling air and discomfort.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The only passenger stirring was a girl whose youth
drooped under the unfavorable influences of foul
air, fatigue, and a strained anxiety to come to the
end of this fateful journey. She had been up while
it was yet dark, and her hand—luggage, locked,
strapped, and as pitifully new at the art of travelling
as the girl herself, clustered about the hem of her
blue serge skirt like chicks about a hen. The engine
shrieked, but its voice sounded weak and far off in
that still ocean of space; the girl tightened her grasp
on the largest of the satchels and looked at the
approaching porter tentatively.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span>
<a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"We&#39;re late twenty-fi&#39;e minutes," he reassured
her, with the hopeless patience of one who has lost
heart in curbing travellers&#39; enthusiasms.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She turned towards the window a pair of shoulders
plainly significant of the burdensome last straw.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Four days and nights in this train"—they were
slower in those days—"and now this extra twenty-five
minutes!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Miss Carmichael&#39;s famous dimple hid itself in
disgust. The demure lines of mouth and chin, that
could always be relied upon for special pleading
when sentence was about to be passed on the dimple
by those who disapproved of dimples, drooped with
disappointment. But the light-brown hair continued
to curl facetiously—it was the sort of hair
whose spontaneous rippling conveys to the seeing
eye a sense of humor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The train plodded across the spacious vacancy
that unrolled itself farther and farther in quest of
the fugitive horizon. The scrap of view that came
within a closer range of vision spun past the car
windows like a bit of stage mechanism, a gigantic
panorama rotating to simulate a race at breakneck
speed. But Miss Carmichael looked with unseeing
eyes; the whirling prairie with its golden flecks of
cactus bloom was but part of the universal strangeness,
and the dull ache of homesickness was in it
all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"My dear! my dear!"—a head in crimpers was
thrust from between the curtains of the section opposite—"I&#39;ve
been awake half the night. I was so
afraid I wouldn&#39;t see you before you got off."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span>
<a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">The head was followed, almost instinctively, by a
hand travelling furtively to the crimpers that gripped
the lady&#39;s brow like barnacles clinging to a keel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary expressed a grieved appreciation at the loss
of rest in behalf of her early departure, and conspicuously
forbore to glance in the direction of the
barnacles, that being a first principle as between
woman and woman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"And, oh, my dear, it gets worse and worse. I&#39;ve
looked at it this morning, and it&#39;s worse in Wyoming
than it was in Colorado. What it &#39;ll be before I
reach California, I shudder to think."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It&#39;s bound to improve," suggested Mary, with
the easy optimism of one who was leaving it. "It
couldn&#39;t be any worse than this, could it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The neuter pronoun, it might be well to state,
signified the prairie; its melancholy personality
having penetrated the very marrow of their train
existence, they had come to refer to it by the
monosyllable, as in certain nether circles the head
of the house receives his superlative distinction in
"He."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Again the locomotive shrieked, again the girl
mechanically clutched the suit-case, as presenting
the most difficult item in the problem of transportation,
and this time the shriek was not an idle
formality. The train slowed down; the uneasy
sleepers behind the green-striped curtains stirred
restlessly with the lessening motion of their uncouth
cradle. The porter came to help her, with the
chastened mien of one whose hopes of largess are
small, the lady with the barnacles called after her
<span class="tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span>
<a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
redundant farewells, and a moment later Miss
Carmichael was standing on the station platform
looking helplessly after the train that toiled and
puffed, yet seemed, in that crystalline atmosphere,
still within arm&#39;s-reach. She watched it till its
floating pennant of smoke was nothing but a gray
feather blowing farther and farther out of sight on
the flat prairie.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The town—it would be unkind to mention its
name—had made merry the night before at the
comprehensive invitation of a sheepman who had
just disposed of his wool-clip, and who said, by way
of general summons, "What&#39;s the use of temptin&#39;
the bank?" "Town," therefore, when Mary Carmichael
first made its acquaintance, was still sleeping
the sleep of the unjust. Those among last
night&#39;s roisterers who had had to make an early
start for their camps were well into the foot-hills by
this time, and would remember with exhilaration
the cracked tinkle of the dance-hall piano as inspiring
music when the lonesomeness of the desert
menaced and the young blood again clamored for
its own.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Town"—it contained in all some two dozen
buildings—was very unlovely in slumber. It
sprawled in the lap of the prairies, a grimy-faced
urchin, with the lines of dismal sophistication writ
deep. Yet where in all the "health resorts" of the
East did air sweep from the clean hill-country with
such revivifying power? It seemed a glad world
of abiding youth. Surely "Town" was but a
dreary illusion, a mirage that hung in the unmapped
<span class="tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span>
<a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
spaces of this new world that God had made and
called good; an omen of the abominations that men
would make when they grew blind to the beauty of
God&#39;s world.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary Carmichael, with much the feelings of a
cat in a strange garret, wandered about the sluggard
town; and presently the blue-and-white sign of a
telegraph office, with the mythological figure of a
hastening messenger, suggested to her that a reassuring
telegram was only Aunt Adelaide&#39;s due.
Whereupon she began to rap on the door of the
office, a scared pianissimo which naturally had
little effect on the operator, who was at home and
asleep some three blocks distant. But the West is
the place for woman if she would be waited upon.
No seven-to-one ratio of the sexes has tempered the
chivalry of her sons of the saddle. A loitering something
in a sombrero saw rather than heard the
rapping, and, at the sight, went in quest of the
dreaming operator without so much as embarrassing
Miss Carmichael with an offer of his services. And
presently the operator, whose official day did not
begin for some two hours yet, appeared, much dishevelled
from running and the cursory nature of his
toilet, prepared to receive a message of life and death.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The wire to Aunt Adelaide ran:</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-quote">
<p class="tei tei-p">"Practically at end of journey. Take stage to Lost Trail
this morning. Am well. Don&#39;t worry about me.</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">"MARY."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="tei tei-p">And the telegraph operator, dimly remembering
that he had heard Lost Trail was a "pizen mean
<span class="tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span>
<a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
country," and that it was tucked some two hundred
miles back in the foot-hills, did not find it very hard
to forgive the girl, who was "practically at end of
journey," particularly as the dimple had come out
of hiding, and he had never been called upon to
telegraph the word "practically" before. He was a
progressive man and liked to extend his experiences.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After sending the telegram, Miss Carmichael, quite
herself by reason of the hill air, felt that she was
getting along famously as a traveller, but that it
was an expensive business, and she was glad to be
"practically" at the end of her journey. And,
drawing from her pocket a square envelope of heavy
Irish linen, a little worn from much reading, but
primarily an envelope that bespoke elegance of
taste on the part of her correspondent, she read:</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-quote">
<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">"LOST TRAIL, WYOMING.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"My Dear Miss Carmichael,—Pray let me assure you
of my gratification that the preliminaries have been so
satisfactorily arranged, and that we are to have you with us
by the end of June. The children are profiting from the
very anticipation of it, and it will be most refreshing to all
us isolated ones to be able to welcome an Eastern girl as a
member of our family.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Although the long journey across the continent is trying,
particularly to one who has not made it before, I hope
you may not find it utterly fatiguing. Please remember
that after leaving the train, it will be necessary to take
a stage to Lost Trail. If it is possible, I shall meet you
with the buckboard at one of the stage stations; otherwise,
keep to the stage route, being careful to change at Dax&#39;s
Ranch.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Unfortunately, the children vary so in their accomplishments
<span class="tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span>
<a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that I fear I can make no suggestions as to what you
may need to bring with you in the way of text-books. But
I think you will find them fairly well grounded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I had a charming letter from Mrs. Kirkland, who said
the pleasantest things possible of you. I am glad the wife
of our Senator was able conscientiously to commend us.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"With our most cordial good wishes for a safe journey,
believe me, dear Miss Carmichael,</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">"Sincerely yours,</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">"SARAH YELLETT."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the mean time, "Town" came yawning to
breakfast. It was not so prankish as it had been
the night before, when it accepted the sheepman&#39;s
broad-gauge hospitality and made merry till the
sun winked from behind the mountains. It made
its way to the low, shedlike eating-house with a
pre-breakfast solemnity bordering on sulkiness. Not
a petticoat was in sight to offset the spurs and
sombreros that filed into breakfast from every point
in the compass, prepared to eat primitively, joke
broadly, and quarrel speedily if that sensitive and
often inconsistent something they called honor
should be brushed however lightly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But the eternal feminine was within, and, discovering
it, the temper of "Town" was changed;
it ate self-consciously, made jokes meet for the ears
of ladies, and was more interested in the girl in the
sailor-hat than it was in remembering old feuds or
laying the foundations of new.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In its interior aspect, the eating-house conveyed
no subtle invitation to eat, drink, and be merry. On
the contrary, its mission seemed to be that of confounding
appetite at every turn. A long, shedlike
<span class="tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span>
<a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
room it was, with walls of unpainted pine, still sweating
from the axe. Festoons of scalloped paper, in
conflicting shades, hung from the ceiling, a menace
to the taller of the guests. On the rough walls some
one, either prompted by a latent spirit of æstheticism
or with an idea of abetting the town towards merrymaking—an
encouragement it hardly required—had
tacked posters of shows, mainly representing the
tank-and-sawmill school of drama.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Miss Carmichael sat at the extreme end of the
long, oilcloth-covered table, on which a straggling
army of salt and pepper shakers, catsup bottles,
and divers commercial condiments seemed to pause
in a discouraged march. A plague of flies was on
everything, and the food was a threat to the hardiest
appetite. One man summed up the steak with,
"You got to work your jaw so hard to eat it that it
ain&#39;t fair to the next meal."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His neighbor heaved a sigh. "This here formation,
whatever it be"—and he turned the meat over
for better inspection—"do shore remind me of an
indestructible doll that an old maid aunt of mine
giv&#39; my sister when we was kids. That doll sort
of challenged me, settin&#39; round oncapable o&#39; bein&#39;
destroyed, and one day I ups an&#39; has a chaw at her.
She war ondestructible, all right; &#39;fore that I concluded
my speriments I had left a couple o&#39; teeth in
her."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, I discyards the steak and draw to a pair
of aces," and the first man helped himself to a
couple of biscuits.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Miss Carmichael knew, by the continual scraping
<span class="tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span>
<a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of chairs across the gritty floor, that the places at
the table must be nearly all taken; and while she
anticipated, with an utterly unreasonable terror,
any further invasion of her seclusion at the end of
the table, still she could not persuade herself to
raise her eyes to detect the progress of the enemy,
even in the interest of the diary she had kept so
conscientiously for the past three days; which was
something of a loss to the diary, as those untamed,
manly faces were well worth looking at. Reckless
they were in many instances, and sometimes the
lines of hardship were cruelly writ across young
faces that had not yet lost the down of adolescence,
but there were humor and endurance and the
courage that knows how to make a crony of death
and get right good sport from the comradeship.
Their faults were the faults of lusty, red-blooded
youth, and their virtues the open-handed generosity,
the ready sympathy of those uncertain tilters at
life who ride or fall in the tourney of a new country.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At present, "the yearling," drinking her execrable
coffee in an agony of embarrassment, weighed
heavily on their minds. They would have liked to
rise as a man and ask if there was anything they
could do for her. But as a glance towards the end
of the table seemed to increase her discomfiture
tenfold, they did the kindest and for them the most
difficult thing and looked in every direction but Miss
Carmichael&#39;s. With a delicacy of perception that
the casual observer might not have given them
credit for, they had refrained from taking seats
directly opposite her, or those immediately on her
<span class="tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span>
<a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
right, which, as she occupied the last seat at the
table, gave her at least a small degree of seclusion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As one after another of them came filing in,
bronzed, rugged, radiating a beauty of youth and
health that no sketchy exigence of apparel could
obscure, some one already seated at the table would
put a foot on a chair opposite him and send it
spinning out into the middle of the floor as a hint
to the new-comer that that was his reserved seat.
And the cow-puncher, sheep-herder, prospector, or
man about "Town," as the case might be, would
take the hint and the chair, leaving the petticoat
separated from the sombreros by a table-land of
oilcloth and a range of four chairs.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But now entered a man who failed to take the
hint of the spinning chair. In fact, he entered the
eating-house with the air of one who has dropped
in casually to look for a friend and, incidentally,
to eat his breakfast. He stopped in the doorway,
scanned the table with deliberation, and started
to make his way towards Mary Carmichael with
something of a swagger. Some one kicked a chair
towards him at the head of the table. Some one
else nearly upset him with one before he reached
the middle, and the Texan remarked, quite audibly,
as he passed:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The damned razor-back!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But the man made his way to the end of the table
and drew out the chair opposite Miss Carmichael
with a degree of assurance that precipitated the
rest of the table into a pretty pother.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Suppose she should countenance his audacity?
<span class="tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span>
<a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The fair have been known to succumb to the headlong
force of a charge, when the persistence of a
long siege has failed signally. What figures they
would cut if she did!—and Simpson, of all men! A
growing tension had crept into the atmosphere of
the eating-house; knives and forks played but intermittently,
and Mary, sitting at the end of the
oilcloth-covered table, felt intuitively that she was
the centre of the brewing storm. Oh, why hadn&#39;t
she been contented to stay at home and make over
her clothes and share the dwindling fortunes of her
aunts, instead of coming to this savage place?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"From the look of the yearling&#39;s chin, I think
he&#39;ll get all that&#39;s coming to him," whispered the
man who had nearly upset him with the second
chair.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You&#39;re right, pard. If I&#39;m any good at reading
brands, she is as self-protective as the McKinley
bill."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The man Simpson was not a pleasant vis-à-vis.
He wore the same picturesque ruffianliness of apparel
as his fellows, but the resemblance stopped there.
He lacked their dusky bloom, their clearness of eye,
the suppleness and easy flow of muscle that is the
hall-mark of these frontiersmen. He was fat and
squat and had not the rich bronzing of wind, sun,
and rain. His small, black eyes twinkled from his
puffy, white face, like raisins in a dough-pudding.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He was ogling Mary amiably when the woman
who kept the eating-house brought him his breakfast.
Mrs. Clark was a potent antidote for the prevailing
spirit of romance, even in this woman-forsaken
<span class="tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span>
<a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
country. A good creature, all limp calico,
Roman nose, and sharp elbows, she brought him his
breakfast with an ill grace that she had not shown
to the others. The men about the table gave him
scant greeting, but the absence of enthusiasm didn&#39;t
embarrass Simpson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He lounged expansively on the table, regarding
Miss Carmichael attentively meanwhile; then favored
her with the result of his observations, "From
the East, I take it." And the dumpling face
screwed into a smile whose mission was pacific.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Every knife and fork in the room suspended
action in anxiety to know how the "yearling"
would take it. Would their chivalry, which strained
at a gnat, be compelled to swallow such a conspicuous
camel as the success of Simpson? With the
attitude he had taken towards the girl, there had
crept into the company an imperceptible change;
deep-buried impulses sprang to the surface. If a
scoundrel like Simpson was going to try his luck,
why shouldn&#39;t they? They didn&#39;t see a pretty girl
once in a blue moon. With the advent of the
green-eyed monster at the board, each man unconsciously
became the rival of his neighbor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But Miss Carmichael merely continued her breakfast,
and if she heard the amiable deductions of
Simpson regarding her, she gave no sign. But a
rebuff to him was in the nature of an appetizer, a
fillip to press the acquaintance. He encroached a
bit farther on the narrow limits of the table and
continued, "Nice weather we&#39;re having."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Miss Carmichael gave her undivided attention to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span>
<a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
her coffee. The spurs and sombreros, that had not
relaxed a muscle in their strained observation of the
little drama, breathed reflectively. Perhaps it was
just as well that they had not emulated Simpson in
his brazen charge; the "yearling" was not to be surprised
into talking, that was certain.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He shore is showing hisself to be a friendly
native," commented the man who had sacrificed
milk-teeth investigating the indestructible doll.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Seems to me that the system he&#39;s playing lacks
a heap of science. My money&#39;s on the yearling."
And the man who had "discarded the steak and
drawn to the biscuits" leaned a little forward that
he might better watch developments.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Simpson by this time fully realized his error, but
failure before all these bantering youngsters was
a contingency not to be accepted lightly. As he
phrased it to himself, it was worth "another throw."
"Seems kind o&#39; lonesome not having any one to talk
to while you&#39;re eatin&#39;, don&#39;t it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Miss Carmichael&#39;s air of perfect composure seemed
a trifle out of tune with her surroundings; the nice
elevation of eyebrow, the slightly questioning curl
of the lip as she, for the first time apparently, became
aware of the man opposite, seemed to demand
a prim drawing-room rather than the atmosphere
of the slouching eating-house.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, really, I&#39;ve hardly had a chance of finding
out." And her eyes were again on her coffee-cup.
And there was joy among the men at table that
they had not rushed in after the manner of those
who have a greater courage than the angels.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span>
<a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No offence meant," deprecated Simpson, with
an uneasy glance towards the other end of the table,
where the men sat with necks craned forward in an
attitude uncomfortably suggestive of hounds straining
at the leash. Simpson felt rather than saw that
something was afoot among the sombreros. There
was a crowding together in whispered colloquy, and
in a flash some half-dozen of them were on their feet
as a man. Descending upon Simpson, they lifted
him, chair and all, to the other end of the table, as
far removed as possible from Miss Carmichael.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The man who thought Simpson&#39;s system lacked
science rubbed his hands in delight. "She took the
trick all right; swept his hand clean off the board!"</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span>

<a name="toc_3" id="toc_3"></a>
<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">The Encounter</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Simpson, from the seat to which he had been
so rapidly transplanted, looked about him with
blinking anxiety. It was more than probable that
the boys intended "to have fun with him," though
his talking, or rather trying to talk, to a girl that
sat opposite him at an eating-house table was, according
to his ethics, plainly none of their business.
He knew he wasn&#39;t popular since he had done for
Jim Rodney&#39;s sheep, though the crime had never
been laid at his door, officially. He had his way to
make, the same as the next one; and, all said and
done, the cattle-men were glad to get Jim Rodney&#39;s
sheep off the range, even if they treated him as a
felon for the part he had played in their extermination.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Thus reasoned Simpson, while he marked with
an uneasy eye that the temper of the company had
grown decidedly prankish with the exit of the girl,
who, after having caused all the trouble, had, with
an irritating quality peculiar to her sex, vanished
through the kitchen door.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Some three or four of the boys now ran to Simpson&#39;s
former seat at the table and rushed towards
<span class="tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span>
<a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him with his half-eaten breakfast, as if the errand
had been one of life and death. They showered
him with mock attentions, waiting on him with an
exaggerated deference, and the pale, fat man, remembering
the hideousness of some of their manifestations
of a sense of humor, breathed hard and
felt a falling-off of appetite.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Costigan, the cattle-man, a strapping Irish giant,
was clearing his throat with ominous sounds that
suggested the tuning-up of a bass fiddle.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Sure, Simpson, me lad, if ye happen to have
a matther av fifty dollars, &#39;tis mesilf that can tell
ye av an illegint invistmint."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Simpson looked up warily, but Costigan&#39;s broad
countenance did not harbor the wraith of a smile.
"What kin I git for fifty chips? &#39;Tain&#39;t much,"
mused the pariah, with the prompt inclination to
spend that stamps the comparative stranger to
ready money.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ye can git a parrut, man—a grane parrut—to
kape ye coompany while ye&#39;re aiting—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Simpson interrupted with an oath.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t be hard on old Simmy; remember he&#39;s
studied for the ministry! How did I savey that
Simpson aimed to be a sharp on doctrine?" A cow-puncher
with a squint addressed the table in general.
"I scents the aroma of dogma about Simpson
in the way he throwed his conversational lariat at
the yearling. He urbanes at her, and then comes his
&#39;firstly,&#39; it being a speculation as to her late grazing-ground,
which he concludes to be the East. His
&#39;secondly&#39; ain&#39;t nothing startling, words familiar to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span>
<a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
us all from our mother&#39;s knee—&#39;nice weather&#39;—the
congregation ain&#39;t visibly moved. His &#39;thirdly&#39;
is insinuating. In it he hints that it ain&#39;t good for
man to be alone at meals—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Twas the congregation that added the &#39;foinelly,&#39;
though, before hastily leaving be the back door!"
and Costigan slapped his thigh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The gentleman in question don&#39;t seem to be
makin&#39; much use of his present conversational
opportunities. I&#39;m feelin&#39; kinder turned down myself";
and the Texan began to look over his six-shooter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The man with the squint looked up and down the
board.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Gentlemen, I believe the foregoing expresses the
sentiment of this company, which, while it incloodes
many foreign and frequent-warring elements, is at
present held together by the natchral tie of eating."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Thumping with knife and fork handles, stamping
of feet, cries of "Hear! hear!" with at least three
cow-boy yells, argued well for a resumption of last
night&#39;s festivities. Simpson glowered, but said nothing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Seems to me you-all goin&#39; the wrong way &#39;bout
drawin&#39; Mistu&#39; Simpson out. He is shy an&#39; has to
be played fo&#39; like a trout, an&#39; heah you-all come at
him like a cattle stampede." The big Texan leaned
towards Simpson. "Now you-all watch my methods.
Mistu&#39; Simpson, seh, what du think of the
prospects of rain?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There was a general recommendation from Simpson
<span class="tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span>
<a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the entire company go to a locality below
the rain-belt.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A boy, plainly "from the East," and looking
as if the ink on his graduating thesis had scarce had
time to dry, was on his feet, swaggering; he would
not have swapped his newly acquired <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">camaraderie</span>
with these bronzed Westerners for the Presidency.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Gentlemen, you have all heard Simpson say it
is lonesome having no one to talk to during meals.
We sympathized with him and offered him a choice
of subjects. He greets our remarks by a conspicuous
silence, varied by profanity. This, gentlemen,
reflects on us, and is a matter demanding public
satisfaction. All who feel that their powers as
conversationalists have been impugned by the silence
of Simpson, please say &#39;Ay.&#39;"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ay" was howled, sung, and roared in every note
of the gamut.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"If me yoong frind here an me roight"—and
Costigan jerked a shoulder towards the boy—"will
be afther closin&#39; that silf-feeding automatic dictionary
av his for a moment, I shud be glad to call the
attintion av the coomp&#39;ny to somethin&#39; in the nature
av an ixtinuatin&#39; circoomsthance in the case av
Simpson."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Hear! hear!" they shouted. The broad countenance
of Costigan beamed with joy at what he was
about to say. "Gintlemin, the silence av Mr.
Simpson is jew in all probabilitee to a certain ivint
recalled by many here prisint, an&#39; more that&#39;s
absent, an&#39; amicablee settled out av coort—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Up to this time the unhappy Simpson had shown
<span class="tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span>
<a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an almost superhuman endurance. Now he bristled—and
after looking up and down the board for a
sympathetic face, and not finding one, he declared,
loudly and generally, "&#39;Tain&#39;t so!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ye may have noticed that frind Simpson do be
t&#39;reatened wid lockjaw in the societee av min, but
in the prisince av a female ye can&#39;t count on him.
Now, talk wid a female is an agreeable, if not a
profitable, way av passin&#39; the toime, but sure ye
niver know where it will ind—as witness Simpson.
This lady I&#39;m recallin&#39;—&#39;tis a matther av two years
ago—followed the ancient and honorable profission
av biscuit shootin&#39; not far from Caspar. Siz Simpson
to the lady some such passin&#39; civilitee as, &#39;Good-marnin&#39;;
plisent weather we&#39;re havin&#39;.&#39; Whereupon
the lady filt a damage to her affictions an&#39;
sued him for breach av promise."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Twan&#39;t that way, at all!" screamed Simpson.
"&#39;Sall a lie!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yu ought er said &#39;Good-evenin&#39;&#39; to the lady,
Mistu Simpson; hit make a diffunce," drawled the
man from Texas, pleasantly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But &#39;twas &#39;Good-marnin&#39;&#39; Simpson made chyce
av," resumed Costigan. "An&#39; the lady replied,
&#39;You&#39;ve broke my heart.&#39; Whereupon Simpson,
havin&#39; a matther av t&#39;ree thousand dollars to pay
for his passin&#39; civilitee, learned thot silince was
goolden."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They all remembered the incident in question,
and thundered applause at the reappearance of an
old favorite. Without warning, a shadow fell across
the sunlight-flooded room, and, as one after another
<span class="tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span>
<a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the men glanced up from the table, they saw
standing in the doorway a man of such malignant
aspect that his look fell across the company like a
menace. The swing of their banter slowed suddenly;
it was as if the cold of a new-turned grave had
struck across the June sunshine checking their roughshod
fun. None of them had the hardihood to joke
with a man that stood in the shadow of death; and
hate and murder looked from the eyes of the man
in the doorway and looked towards Simpson. One
by one they perceived the man of the shadow, all
but Simpson, eating steak drowned in Worcestershire.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The man in the doorway was tall and lean, and
the prison blench upon his face was in unpleasant
contrast to the ruddy tan of the faces about the
table. His sombrero was tipped back and the hair
hung dank about the pale, sweating forehead,
suggestive of sickness. But weak health did not
imply weak purpose; every feature in that hawk-like
face was sharp with hatred, and in the narrowing
eye was vengeance that is sweet.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He stood still; there was in his hatred a something
hypnotic that grew imperceptibly and imperceptibly
communicated itself to the men at table.
He gloated over the eating fat man as if he had
dwelt much in imagination on the sight and was in
no hurry to curtail his joy at the reality. The men
began to get restless, shuffle their feet, moisten their
lips; only the college boy spoke, and then from a
wealth of ignorance, knowing nothing of the rugged,
give-and-take justice of the plains—an eye for an
<span class="tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span>
<a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
eye, a tooth for a tooth, and the law and the courts
go hang while a man&#39;s got a right arm to pull a trigger.
Not one in all that company, even the cattle-men
whose interests were opposed to Rodney&#39;s, but
felt the justice of his errand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"When did they let him out?" whispered the
college boy; and then, "Oughtn&#39;t we to do something?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yis, me son," whispered Costigan. "We ought
to sit still and learn a thing or two."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The fat man cleaned his plate with a crust of bread
stuck on the point of a knife. There was nothing
more to eat in the way of substantials, and he
debated pouring a little more of the sauce on his
plate and mopping it with a bit of bread still uneaten.
Considering the pro and con of this extra
tid-bit, he glanced up and saw the gaunt man
standing in the doorway.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Simpson dropped the knife from his shaking hand
and started up with a cry that died away in a gurgle,
an inhuman, nightmare croak. He looked about
wildly, like a rat in a trap, then backed towards the
wall. The men about the table got up, then cleared
away in a circle, leaving the fat man. It was all
like a dream to the college boy, who had never seen
a thing of the kind before and could not realize now
that it was happening. Rodney advanced, never
once relaxing the look in which he seemed to hold
his enemy as in a vise. Simpson was like a man
bewitched. Once, twice, he made a grab for his
revolver, but his right hand seemed to have lost
power to heed the bidding of his will. Rodney,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span>
<a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
now well towards the centre of the room, waited,
with a suggestion of ceremony, for Simpson to get
his six-shooter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was one of those moments in which time seems
to have become petrified. The limp-clad proprietress
of the eating-house, made curious by the
sudden silence, looked in from the kitchen. Simpson,
his eyes wandering like a trapped rat, saw, and
called, through teeth that chattered in an ague of
fear, "Ree—memm—her thth—there&#39;s la—dies
p—present! For Gawd&#39;s sake, remember t—there&#39;s
ladies p—present!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The pale man looked towards the kitchen, and,
seeing the woman, he gave Simpson a look in which
there was only contempt. "You&#39;ve hid behind the
law once, and this time it&#39;s petticoats. The open
don&#39;t seem to have no charm for you. But—" He
didn&#39;t finish, there was no need to. Every one
knew and understood. He put up his revolver and
walked into the street.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The men broke into shouts of laughter, loud and
ringing, then doubled up and had it out all over
again. And their noisy merriment was as clear an
indication of the suddenly lifted strain, at the
averted shooting, as it was of their enjoyment of the
farce. Simpson, relieved of the fear of sudden
death, now sought to put a better face on his
cowardice. Now that his enemy was well out of
sight, Simpson handled his revolver with easy
assurance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Put ut up," shouted Costigan, above the general
uproar. "&#39;Tis toime to fear a revolver in
<span class="tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span>
<a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the hands av Simpson whin he&#39;s no intinsions av
shootin&#39;."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Simpson still attempted to harangue the crowd,
but his voice was lost in the general thigh-slapping
and the shouts and roars that showed no signs of
abating. But when he caught a man by the coat
lapel in his efforts to secure a hearing, that was
another matter, and the man shook him off as if his
touch were contagion. Simpson, craving mercy on
account of petticoats, evading a meeting that was
"up to him," they were willing to stand as a laughing-stock,
but Simpson as an equal, grasping the
lapels of their coats, they would have none of.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He slunk away from them to a corner of the
eating-house, feeling the stigma of their contempt,
yet afraid to go out into the street where his enemy
might be waiting for him. Much of death and
blood and recklessness "Town" had seen and condoned,
but cowardice was the unforgivable sin. It
balked the rude justice of these frontiersmen and
tampered with their code, and Simpson knew that
the game had gone against him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What was it all about? Were they in earnest,
or was it only their way of amusing themselves?"
inquired Mary Carmichael, who had slipped into
Mrs. Clark&#39;s kitchen after the men at the table had
taken things in hand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Jim Rodney was in earnest, an&#39; he had reason to
be. That man Simpson was paid by a cattle outfit—now,
mind, I ain&#39;t sayin&#39; which—to get Jim
Rodney&#39;s sheep off the range. They had threatened
him and cut the throats of two hundred of his herd
<span class="tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span>
<a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as a warning, but Jim went right on grazin&#39; &#39;em,
same as he had always been in the habit of doing.
Well, I&#39;m told they up and makes Simpson an offer
to get rid of the sheep. Jim has over five thousand,
an&#39; it&#39;s just before lambing, and them pore ewes, all
heavy, is being druv&#39; down to Watson&#39;s shearing-pens,
that Jim always shears at. Jim an&#39; two herders
and a couple of dawgs—least, this is the way
I heard it—is drivin&#39; &#39;em easy, &#39;cause, as I said
before, it&#39;s just before lambing. It does now seem
awful cruel to me to shear just before lambing, but
that&#39;s their way out here.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, nothing happens, and Jim ain&#39;t more&#39;n
two hours from the pens an&#39; he comes to that place
on the road that branches out over the top of a
cañon, and there some one springs out of a clump of
willows an&#39; dashes into the herd and drives the
wether that&#39;s leading right over the cliff. The
leaders begin to follow that wether, and they go
right over the cliff like the pore fools they are. The
herder fired and tried to drive &#39;em back, they tell me,
an&#39; he an&#39; the dawg were shot at from the clump of
willows by some one else who was there. Three
hundred sheep had gone over the cliff before Jim
knew what was happening. He rode like mad right
through the herd to try and head &#39;em off; but you
know what sheep is like—they&#39;re like lost souls
headin&#39; for damnation. Nothing can stop &#39;em when
they&#39;re once started. And Jim lost every head—started
for the shearing-pens a rich man—rich for
Jim—an&#39; seen everything he had swept away before
his eyes, his wife an&#39; children made paupers. My
<span class="tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span>
<a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
son he come by and found him. He said that Jim
was sittin&#39; huddled up in a heap, his knees drawed
up under his chin, starin&#39; straight up into the noonday
sky, same as if he was askin&#39; God how He could be
so cruel. His dead dawg, that they had shot, was
by the side of him. The herder that was with Jim
had taken the one that was shot into Watson&#39;s, so
when my son found Jim he was alone, sittin&#39; on the
edge of the cliff with his dead dawg, an&#39; the sky
about was black with buzzards; an&#39; Jim he just sat
an&#39; stared up at &#39;em, and when my son spoke to him
he never answered any more than a dead man. He
shuck him by the arm, but Jim just sat there, watchin&#39;
the sun, the buzzards, and the dead sheep."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Was nothing done to this man Simpson?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The cattle outfit that he done the dirty work
for swore an alibi for him. Jim has been in hard
luck ever since. He&#39;s been rustlin&#39; cattle right
along; but Lord, who can blame him? He got into
some trouble down to Rawlins—shot a man he
thought was with Simpson, but who wasn&#39;t—and
he&#39;s been in jail ever since. Course now that he&#39;s
out Simpson&#39;s bound to get peppered. Glad it
didn&#39;t happen here, though. &#39;Twould be a kind of
unpleasant thing to have connected with a eating-house,
don&#39;t you think so?" she inquired, with the
grim philosophy of the country.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The eating-house patrons had gone their several
ways, and the quiet of the dining-room was oppressive
by contrast with its late boisterousness. Mrs.
Clark, her hands imprisoned in bread-dough, begged
Mary to look over the screen door and see if anything
<span class="tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span>
<a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was happening. "I&#39;m always suspicious when
it&#39;s quiet. I know they&#39;re in deviltry of some sort."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary tiptoed to the door and peeped over, but
the room was deserted, save for Simpson, huddled
in a corner, biting his finger-nails. "The nasty
thing!" exploded Mrs. Clark, when she had received
the bulletin. "I&#39;d turn him out if it wasn&#39;t for the
notoriety he might bring my place in gettin&#39; killed
in front of it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I dare say I&#39;d better go and see after my trunk;
it&#39;s still on the station platform." Mary wondered
what her prim aunts would think of her for sitting
in Mrs. Clark&#39;s kitchen, but it had seemed so much
more of a refuge than the sordid streets of the
hideous little town, with its droves of men and
never a glimpse of a woman that she had been only
too glad to avail herself of the invitation of the
proprietress to "make herself at home till the stage
left."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, good luck to you," said Mrs. Clark, wiping
her hand only partially free from dough and presenting
it to Miss Carmichael. She had not inquired
where the girl was going, nor even hinted to discover
where she came from, but she gave her the godspeed
that the West knows how to give, and the girl felt
better for it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At the station, where Mary shortly presented
herself, in the interest of that old man of the sea
of all travellers, luggage, she learned that the stage
did not leave town for some three-quarters of an
hour yet. A young man, manipulating many sheets
of flimsy, yellow paper covered with large, flourishing
<span class="tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span>
<a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
handwriting, looked up in answer to her inquiries
about Lost Trail. This young man, whose
accent, clothes, and manner proclaimed him "from
the East," whither, in all probability, he would
shortly return if he did not mend his ways, disclaimed
all knowledge of the place as if it were an
undesirable acquaintance. But before he could
deny it thrice, a man who had heard the cabalistic
name was making his way towards the desk, the
pride of the traveller radiating from every feature.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The cosmopolite who knew Lost Trail was the
type of man who is born to be a Kentucky colonel,
and perhaps may have achieved his destiny before
coming to this "No Man&#39;s Land," for reasons into
which no one inquired, and which were obviously
no one&#39;s business. They knew him here by the
name of "Lone Tooth Hank," and he wore what had
been, in the days of his colonelcy—or its equivalent—a
frock-coat, restrained by the lower button, and
thus establishing a waist-line long after nature had
had the last word to say on the subject. With this
he wore the sombrero of the country, and the combination
carried a rakish effect that was positively
sinister.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The scornful clerk introduced Mary as a young
lady inquiring about some place in the bad-lands.
Off came the sombrero with a sweep, and Lone
Tooth smiled in a way that accented the dental
solitaire to which he owed his name. Miss Carmichael,
concealing her terror of this casual cavalier,
inquired if he could tell her the distance to Lost
Trail.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span>
<a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I sho&#39;ly can, and with, consid&#39;able pleasure."
The sombrero completed a semicircular sweep and
arrived in the neighborhood of Mr. Hank&#39;s heart in
significance of his vassalage to the fair sex. He
proceeded:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Lost Trail sutney is right lonesome. A friend
of mine gets a little too playful fo&#39; the evah-increasin&#39;
meetropolitan spirit of this yere camp, and tries
a little tahget practice on the main bullyvard, an&#39;
finds the atmospheah onhealthful in consequence.
Hearin&#39; that the quiet solitude of Lost Trail is what
he needs, he lit out with the following circumstance
thereof happenin&#39;. One day something in his harness
giv&#39; way—and he recollects seein&#39; a boot
sunnin&#39; itself back in the road &#39;bout a quartah of a
mile. An&#39; he figgahs he&#39;ll borry a strip of leather
off the boot to mend his harness. Back he goes and
finds it has a kind of loaded feelin&#39;. So my friend
investigates—and I be blanked if there wasn&#39;t a
foot and leg inside of it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Miss Carmichael had always exercised a super-feminine
self-restraint in the case of casual mice,
and it served her in the present instance. Instead
of screaming, she said, after the suppression of a
gasp or two:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Thank you so much, but I won&#39;t detain you
any longer. Your information makes Lost Trail
even more interesting than I had expected."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Besides, Miss Carmichael had a faint suspicion
that this might be a preconcerted plan to terrify
the "lady tenderfoot," and she prided herself on
being equal to the situation. The time at her
<span class="tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span>
<a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
disposal before the stage would embark on that
unknown sea of prairies she spent in the delectable
pastime of shopping. The financial and social interests
of the town seemed to converge in Hugous
&amp; Co.&#39;s "trading store," where Miss Carmichael
invested in an extra package of needles for the
mere excitement of being one of the shoppers,
though her aunt Adelaide had stocked the little
plaid-silk work-bag to repletion with every variety
of needle known to woman. She pricked up her
ears, meanwhile, at some of the purchases made
by the cow-boys for their camp-larders—devilled
ham, sardines, canned tomatoes heading the list
as prime favorites. Did these strapping border
lads live by the fruit of the tin alone? Apparently
yes, with the sophisticated accompaniment of soda
biscuit, to judge by the quantity of baking-powder
they invested in—literally pounds of it. Men in
any other condition of life would have died of slow
poisoning as the result of it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There were other customers at Hugous&#39; that
morning besides the spurred and booted cow-puncher
and his despised compeer, the sheep-herder.
That restless emigrant class, whose origin, as
a class, lay in the community of its own uncertain
schemes of fortune; the West, with her splendid,
lavish promises, called them from their thriftless
farms in the South and their gray cabins in New
England. They began their journeying towards
the land of promise long before the Indians had
ever seen the shrieking "fire-wagon." All day they
would toil over the infinitude of prairie, the sun that
<span class="tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span>
<a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hid nightly behind that maddeningly elusive vanishing-point,
the horizon, their only guide. But the
makeshifts of the wagon life were not without charm.
They began to wander in quest of they knew not
precisely what, and from these vague beginnings
there had sprung into existence that nomadic
population that was once such a feature of the far
West, but is now going the way of the Indians and
the cow-boys.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This breathing-space in the long journey had
for them the stimulus of a holiday-making. They
bought their sides of bacon and their pounds of
coffee as merrily as if they were playing a game of
forfeits, the women fingering the calico they did
not want for the joy of pricing and making shoppers&#39;
talk.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The scene had a scriptural flavor that not even
the blue overalls of the men nor the calico gowns
of the women could altogether eliminate. Their
wagons, bulging with household goods and trailing
with kitchen utensils secured by bits of rope, were
drawn up in front of the trading-store. From a
pump, at some little distance, the pilgrims filled
their stone water-bottles, for the wise traveller does
not trust to the chance springs of the desert.
Baskets of chickens were strapped to many of the
wagons, but whether the unhappy fowls were designed
to supply fresh eggs and an occasional fricassée,
or were taken for the pleasure of their company,
there was no means of determining short of
impertinent cross-questioning. Sometimes a cow,
and invariably a dog, formed one of the family
<span class="tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span>
<a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
party, and an edifying <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">esprit de corps</span> seemed to
dwell among them all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Lone Tooth Hank, in his capacity of man about
town, stood on the steps of Hugous&#39; watching the
preparations; and, seeing Miss Carmichael, approached
with the air of an old and tried family friend.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Do I obsehve yu regyarding oweh &#39;settleahs,&#39;
called settleahs &#39;cause they nevah settle?" Hank
laughed gently, as one who has made a joke meet
for ladies. "I&#39;ve known whole famblies to bohn an&#39;
raise right in one of them wagons; and tuhn out a
mighty fine, endurin&#39; lot, too, this hyeh prospectin&#39;
round afteh somethin&#39; they wouldn&#39;t reco&#39;nize if
they met. Gits to be a habit same as drink. They
couldn&#39;t live in a house same as humans, not if yu
filled their gyarden with nuggets an&#39; their well
with apple-jack."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Miss Carmichael looked attentive but said nothing.
In truth, she was more afraid of Hank, his
obvious gallantry, and his grewsome tales of boots
with legs in them than she was of the unknown
terrors of Lost Trail.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I believe that is my stage," she said, as a red
conveyance not unlike a circus wagon halted at
some little distance from the trading-store. And
as she spoke she saw four of her companions of the
breakfast-table heading towards the stage, each with
a piece of her precious luggage. Mary Carmichael
was precipitated in a sudden panic; she had heard
tales of the pranks of these playful Western squires—a
little gun-play to induce the terrified tenderfoot
to put a little more spirit into his Highland fling,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span>
<a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
"by request." She remembered their merrymaking
with Simpson at breakfast. What did they intend
to do with her belongings? And as she remembered
the little plaid sewing-bag that Aunt Adelaide had
made for her—surreptitiously drying her tears in the
mean time—when she remembered that bag and the
possibility of its being submitted to ignominy, she
could have cried or done murder, she wasn&#39;t sure
which.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, &#39;pon my wohd, heah ah the boys with
yo&#39; baggage. How time du fly!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh!" she gasped, "what are they going to do
with it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Place it on the stage, awaitin&#39; yo&#39; ohdahs."
And to her expression of infinite relief—"Yo&#39; didn&#39;t
think any disrepec&#39; would be shown the baggage of
a lady honorin&#39; this hyeh metropolis with her presence?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She thanked the knights of the lariat the more
warmly for her unjust suspicions. They stowed
away the luggage with the deft capacity of men who
have returned to the primitive art of using their
hands. She climbed beside the driver on the box
of the stage. Lone Tooth Hank and the cow-punchers
chivalrously raised their sombreros with
a simultaneous spontaneity that suggested a flight
of rockets. The driver cracked his whip and turned
the horses&#39; heads towards the billowing sea of foot-hills,
and the last cable that bound Mary Carmichael
to civilization was cut.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span>

<h1 class="tei tei-head">III</h1>
<a name="toc_4" id="toc_4"></a>
<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">Leander And His Lady</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The only stage passenger besides Miss Carmichael
was a fat lady, whose entire luggage
seemed to consist of luncheon—pasteboard boxes
of sandwiches, baskets of fruit, napkins of cake.
These she began to dispose of, before the stage had
fairly started, with an industry almost automatic,
continuing faithful to her post as long as the supplies
lasted. Then she dozed, sleeping the sleep of the
just and those who keep their mouths open. From
time to time the stage-driver invoked his team in
cabalistic words, and each time the horses toiled
forward with fresh energy; but progress became a
mockery in that ocean of space, their driving seemed
as futile as the sport of children who crack a whip
and play at stage-coach with a couple of chairs;
the mountains still mocked in the distance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A flat, unbroken sweep of country, a tangle of
straggling sage-brush, a glimpse of foot-hills in the
distance, was the outlook mile after mile. The day
grew pitilessly hot. Clouds of alkaline dust swept
aimlessly over the desert or whirled into spirals till
lost in space. From horizon to horizon the sky
was one cloudless span of blue that paled as it
<span class="tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span>
<a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dipped earthward. Mary Carmichael dozed and
wakened, but the prospect was always the same—the
red stage crawling over the wilderness, making
no evident progress, and always the sun, the sage-brush,
and the silence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was all so overwhelmingly different from the
peaceful atmosphere of things at home. The mellow
Virginia country, with its winding, red roads, wealth
of woodland, and its grave old houses that were the
more haughtily aloof for the poverty that gnawed at
their vitals. This wilderness was so gaunt, so parched;
she closed her eyes and thought of a bit of landscape
at home. A young forest of silver beeches
growing straight and fine as the threads on a loom;
and through the gray perspective of their satin-smooth
trunks you caught the white gleam of a fairy
cascade as it tumbled over the moss-grown stones
to the brook below. It was like a bit from a Japanese
garden in its delicate artificiality.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And harder to leave than these cherished bits
of landscape had been the old house Runnymede,
that always seemed dozing in the peaceful comatose
of senility. It was beyond the worry of debt; the
succession of mortgages that sapped its vitality and
wrote anxious lines on the faces of Aunt Adelaide
and Aunt Martha was nothing to the old house. Had
it not sheltered Carmichaels for over a century?—it
had faith in the name. But Mary could never
remember when the need of money to pay the
mortgage had not invaded the gentle routine of
their home-life, robbing the sangaree of its delicate
flavor in the long, sleepy summer afternoons, invading
<span class="tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span>
<a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the very dining-room, an unwelcome guest at
the old mahogany table, prompting Aunt Adelaide
to cast anxious glances at the worn silver—would it
go to pay that blood-sucking mortgage next?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But hardest of all to leave had been Archie, best
and most promising of young brothers—Archie, who
had come out ahead of his class in the high-school,
all ready to go to The University—the University
of Virginia is always "The University"; but who,
it had seemed at a certain dark season, must give
up this long-cherished hope for lack of the wherewithal.
Mary, being four years older than her
brother and quite twenty, had long felt a maternal
obligation to administer his affairs. If he did
not go to the university, like his father and grandfather
before him, it would be because she had failed
in her duty. At this particular phase of the domestic
problem there had appeared, in a certain
churchly periodical, a carefully worded advertisement
for a governess, and the subsequent business
of references, salary, and information to be imparted
and received proving eminently satisfactory,
Mary had finally received a tearful permission from
her aunts to depart for some place in Wyoming, the
name of which was not even to be found on the map.
She was to consider herself quite one of the family,
and the compensation was to be fifty dollars a month.
Archie would now be able to go to "The University."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As the day wore on the sage-brush became
scarcer and grayer, there were fewer flowering cacti,
and the great white patches of alkali grew more and
more frequent. In the distance there was a riot
<span class="tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span>
<a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of rainbow tints—violet, pink, and pale orange. It
seemed inconceivable that such barrenness could
produce such wealth of color; nothing could have
been more beautiful—not even the changing colors
on a pigeon&#39;s neck—than the coppery iridescence,
shading to cobalt and blue on some of the buttes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Night had fallen before they made the first break
in their journey. The low, beetle-browed cabin that
faced them in the wilderness carried in its rude
completeness a hint of the prestidigitateur&#39;s art—a
world of desolation, and behold a log cabin with
smoke issuing from the chimney and curtains at the
windows! The interior was unplastered, but this
shortcoming was surmounted by tacking cheesecloth
neatly over the logs, a device at once simple and
strategic, as in the lamplight the effect was that of
plaster. Miss Carmichael, suddenly released from
the actual rumbling of the stage, felt its confused
motion the more strongly in imagination, and hardly
knew whether she was eating canned tomatoes,
served uncooked directly from the tin, fried steak,
black coffee, and soda biscuit, in company with the
fat lady, the stage-driver, and the woman who kept
the road ranch, or if it was all some Alice in Wonderland
delusion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The fat lady had brought her own bedding—an
apoplectic roll of bedquilts—and these she insisted
on making a bed of, despite the protests of the
ranch-woman, who seemed to detect a covert insinuation
against her accommodations in the precedent.
Miss Carmichael profited by the controversy.
The landlady, touched no doubt by the simple faith
<span class="tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span>
<a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of a traveller who trusted to the beds of a road-ranch,
or because she was young or a girl, led the
way in triumph to her own bedroom, and indicating
an imposing affair with pillow-shams, she defied Miss
Carmichael to find a more comfortable bed "in the
East."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the unaccountable manner of these desert
conveyances, that creak and groan across the arid
wastes with an apparently lumbering inconsequence,
the stage that brought the travellers to the Dax
ranch left at sunrise to pursue a seemingly erratic
career along the North Platte, while Miss Carmichael
and the fat lady were to continue their journey with
one Lemuel Chugg, who drove a stage northward
towards the Red Desert, when he was sober enough
to handle the ribbons.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Breakfast was largely devoted to speculation regarding
the approximate condition of Mr. Chugg—would
he be wholly or partially incapacitated for
his job? Mrs. Dax, flirting a feather-duster in the
neighborhood of Miss Carmichael in a futile effort
to beguile her into giving a reason for her solitary
journey across the desert, took a gloomy view of the
situation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But Miss Carmichael kept her own counsel. Not
so the fat lady. Falling into the snare ingenuously
set for another, she divulged her name, place of
residence, and the object of her travels, which was to
visit a son on Sweetwater. Furthermore, she stated
the probable cause of every death in her family for
the past thirty-five years. Miss Carmichael felt
an especial interest in an Uncle Henry who "died
<span class="tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span>
<a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of a Friday along of eating clams." He stood out
with such refreshing vividness against a background
of neutralities who succumbed to consumption,
bile colic, and other more familiar ailments
of the patent-medicine litany. But loquacity, apparently,
like virtue, is its own reward, for the landlady
scarce vouchsafed a comment on this dismal
recitative, while Miss Carmichael remained the object
of her persistent attentions.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But there seemed to be no topic of universal
interest but Chugg&#39;s condition, Mrs. Dax finally
asserting, "Before I&#39;d trust my precious neck to
him, I&#39;d get Mr. Dax to shoot me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Meditating on this Spartan statement, Mary and
the fat lady became aware for the first time of a
subtle, silent force in the domestic economy. But
so unobtrusive was this influence that one had to
scrutinize very closely, indeed, to detect the evanescent
personality of Mrs. Dax&#39;s husband. Leander
was his name, but it is safe to say that he swam no
Hellesponts for the masterful wife of his bosom.
Otherwise he was slender, willowy, bald; if he ever
stood straight enough to get the habitually apologetic
crooks out of his knees, he would be tall;
but so in the habit was he of repressing himself
in the marital presence that Leander passed for
middle height. He waited on the table at breakfast
with the dumb submissiveness of a trained dog
that has been taught to give pathetic imitations of
human servility. But no sooner had his lady left
the room than Leander began quite brazenly to call
attention to himself as a man and an individual,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span>
<a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
coughing, rattling his dishes, and clearing his throat.
Mary and the fat lady, out of very pity, responded
to these crude signals with overtures equally frank,
and Leander ventured finally to inquire if they
aimed to spend the night at his brother&#39;s ranch, it
being the next mess-box between here and nowhere.
They admitted that his brother&#39;s ranch was their
next stopping-place, and Leander went through
perfect contortions of apology and self-effacement
before he could bring himself to ask them to do him
a favor. It would have taken a very stern order of
womankind to refuse anything so abject, and they
blindly committed themselves to the pledge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Tell him I send my compliments," he whispered,
and, looking about him furtively, he repeated the
blood-curdling request.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Is that all?" sniffed the fat lady, at no pains to
conceal her disappointment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It&#39;s enough, if it was known, to raise a war-whoop
and stampede this yere family." His glance
at the door through which his wife had disappeared
was pregnant with meaning.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Family troubles?" asked the fat lady, as a
gourmet might say "Truffles."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Looks like it," said Leander, dismally. "Me
and Johnnie don&#39;t ask for nothin&#39; better than to
bask in each other&#39;s company; but our wives insists
on keepin&#39; up the manoeuvres of a war-dance
the whole endoorin&#39; time."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"So," said the fat lady, as a gourmet might tell
of a favorite way of preparing truffles, "it&#39;s a case
of wives?"</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span>
<a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, marm, an&#39; teeth an&#39; nails an&#39; husbands
thrown in, when they get a sight of each other&#39;s
petticoats."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;ve known sisters-in-law not to agree," helped
on the fat lady, by way of an encouraging parallel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"While I deplores usin&#39; such a comparison to the
refinin&#39; and softenin&#39; inflooance of wimmen, the
meetin&#39; of the Dax ladies by chanst anywheres has
all the elements of danger and excitement that accompanies
an Injun uprisin&#39;."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The travellers looked all manner of encouragement.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You see, my wife&#39;s a great housekeeper; her
talent lies"—and here Leander winked knowingly—"in
managin&#39; the help."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Land&#39;s sake!" interrupted the fat lady. "Why
don&#39;t you kick?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Leander sighed softly. "I tried to once. As an
experiment it partook of the trustfulness of a mule
kickin&#39; against the stony walls of Badger Cañon.
But to resoom about the difficulties that split the
Dax family. Before Johnnie got mislaid in that
matrimonial landslide o&#39; his, he herds with us.
Me an&#39; him does the work of this yere shack, and
my wife just roominates and gives her accomplishments
as manager full play. She never put her
hand in dirty water any more than Mrs. Cleveland
sittin&#39; up in the White House parlor. Johnnie
done the fancy cookin&#39;; he could make a pie like
any one&#39;s maw, and while you was lost to the world
in the delights of masticatin&#39; it, he&#39;d have all his
greasy dishes washed up and put away—"</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span>
<a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No wonder she hated to lose a man like that,"
interrupted the fat lady, feelingly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But he took to pinin&#39; and proclaimin&#39; that he
shore was a lone maverick, and he just stampeded
round lookin&#39; for trouble and bleatin&#39; a song that
went:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">"&#39;No one to love,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">None to caress.&#39;</p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, the lady that answers his signal of distress
don&#39;t bear none of the brands of this yere range.
She lives back East, and him and her took up
their claims in each other&#39;s affections through a
matrimonial paper known as <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">The Heart and Hand</span>.
So they takes their pens in hand and gets through
a hard spell of courtin&#39; on paper. Love plumb
locoes Johnnie. His spellin&#39; don&#39;t suit him, his
handwritin&#39; don&#39;t suit him, his natchral letters don&#39;t
suit him. So off he sends to Denver for all the
letter-writin&#39; books he can buy—<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Handbook of
Correspondence, The Epistolary Guide, The Ready
Letter-Writer</span>, and a stack more. There&#39;s no denyin&#39;
it, Johnnie certainly did sweat hisself over them
letters."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Land&#39;s sakes!" said the fat lady.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, marm; he used to read &#39;em to me, beginnin&#39;
how he had just seized five minutes to write to her,
when he&#39;d worked the whole day like a mule over it.
She seemed to like the brand, an&#39; when he sent her
the money to come out here an&#39; get married, she
come as straight as if she had been mailed with a
postage-stamp."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span>
<a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The brazen thing!" said the fat lady.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"They stopped here, goin&#39; home to their place.
My Lord! warn&#39;t she a high-flyer! She done her
hair like a tied-up horse-tail—my wife called it a
Sikey knot—and it stood out a foot from her head.
Some of the boys, kinder playful, wanted to throw
a hat at it and see if it wouldn&#39;t hang, but they
refrained, out of respect to the feelin&#39;s of the groom.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"From the start," continued Leander, "the two
Mrs. Daxes just hankered to get at each other; an&#39;
while I, as a slave to the fair sex"—here he bowed to
the fat lady and to Miss Carmichael—"hesitates to
use such langwidge in their presence, the attitood
of them two female wimmin shorely reminds me of
a couple of unfriendly dawgs just hankerin&#39; to chaw
each other.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"At first, Johnnie waited on her hand an&#39; foot,
and she just read novels and played stylish all the
time and danced. She was the hardest dancer that
ever struck this yere trail, and she could give lessons
to any old war-dancin&#39; chief up to the reservation.
No dance she ever heard of was too far for her to go
to. She just went and danced till broad daylight.
Many a man would have took to dissipation, in his
circumstances, but Johnnie just lost heart and grew
slatterly. Why, he&#39;d leave his dishes go from one
day till the next—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There&#39;s more as would leave their dishes from
one day till the next if they wasn&#39;t looked after."
And the wife of his bosom stood in the door like a
vengeful household goddess. Mr. Dax made a grab
for the nearest plates.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The arrival of Chugg&#39;s stage with the mail
should have been coincident with the departure
of the stage that brought the travellers
from "Town," but Chugg was late—a tardiness
ascribed to indulgence in local lethe waters, for
Lemuel Chugg had survived a romance and drank
to forget that woman is a variable and a changeable
thing. In consequence of which the sober stage-driver
departed without the mails, leaving Mary
Carmichael and the fat lady to scan the horizon
for the delinquent Chugg, and incidentally to hear
a chapter of prairie romance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Some sort of revolution seemed to be in progress
in the room in which the travellers had breakfasted.
Mrs. Dax had assumed the office of dictator, with
absolute sway. Leander, as aide-de-camp, courier,
and staff, executed marvellous feats of domestic
engineering. The late breakfast-table, swept and
garnished with pigeon-holes, became a United States
post-office, prepared to transact postal business, and
for the time being to become the social centre of
the surrounding country.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Down the yellow road that climbed and dipped
<span class="tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span>
<a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and climbed and dipped again over foot-hills and
sprawling space till it was lost in a world without
end, Mary Carmichael, standing in the doorway,
watched an atom, so small that it might have been a
leaf blowing along in the wind, turn into a horseman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There was inspiration for a hundred pictures in
the way that horse was ridden. No flashes of daylight
between saddle and rider in the jolting, Eastern
fashion, but the long, easy sweep that covers ground
imperceptibly and is a delight to the eye. It needed
but the solitary figure to signify the infinitude of
space in the background. In all that great, wide
world the only hint of life was the galloping horseman,
the only sound the rhythmical ring of the nearing
hoofs. The rider, now close enough for Miss Carmichael
to distinguish the features, was a thorough
dandy of the saddle. No slouching garb of exigence
and comfort this, but a pretty display of doeskin
gaiter, varnished boot, and smart riding-breeches.
The lad—he could not have been, Miss Carmichael
thought, more than twenty—was tanned a splendid
color not unlike the bloomy shading on a nasturtium.
And when the doughty horseman made out the girl
standing in the doorway, he smiled with a lack of
formality not suggested by the town-cut of his
trappings. Throwing the reins over the neck of the
horse with the real Western fling, he slid from the
saddle in a trice, and—Mary Carmichael experienced
something of the gasping horror of a shocked old
lady as she made out two splendid braids of thick,
black hair. Her doughty cavalier was no cavalier
at all, but a surprisingly handsome young woman.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span>
<a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Miss Carmichael gasped a little even as she extended
her hand, for the masquerader had pulled
off her gauntlet and held out hers as if she was conferring
the freedom of the wilderness. It was
impossible for a homesick girl not to respond to
such heartiness, though it was with difficulty at first
that Mary kept her eyes on the girl&#39;s face. Curiosity,
agreeably piqued, urged her to take another glimpse
of the riding clothes that this young woman wore
with such supreme unconcern.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Now, "in the East" Mary Carmichael had not been
in the habit of meeting black-haired goddesses who
rode astride and whose assurance of the pleasure
of meeting her made her as self-conscious as on her
first day at dancing-school; and though she tried
to prove her cosmopolitanism by not betraying this,
the attempt was rather a failure.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Are you surprised that I did not wait for an
introduction?" the girl in the riding clothes asked,
noticing Mary&#39;s evident uneasiness; "but you don&#39;t
know how good it is to see a girl. I&#39;m so tired of
spurs and sombreros and cattle and dust and distance,
and there&#39;s nothing else here."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Where I come from it&#39;s just the other way—too
many petticoats and hat-pins."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The horseman who was no horseman dropped
Miss Carmichael&#39;s hand and went into the house.
Mary wondered if she ought to have been more
cordial.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">From the back door came Leander, with dishcloths,
which he began to hang on the line in a dumb,
driven sort of way.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span>
<a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Who is she?" asked Mary.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Her?" he interrogated, jerking his head in the
direction of the house. "The postmistress, Judith
Rodney; yes, that&#39;s her name." He dropped his
voice in the manner of one imparting momentous
things. "She never wears a skirt ridin&#39;, any more
than a man."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary felt that she was tempting Leander into the
paths of gossip, undoubtedly his besetting sin, but
she could not resist the temptation to linger. He
had disposed of his last dish-cloth, and he withdrew
the remaining clothes-pin from his mouth in a way
that was pathetically feminine.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She keeps the post-office here, since Mrs. Dax
lost the job, and boards with us; p&#39;r&#39;aps it&#39;s because
she is my wife&#39;s successor in office, or p&#39;a&#39;ps it&#39;s jest
the natural grudge that wimmin seem to harbor
agin each other, I dunno, but they don&#39;t sandwich
none."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Leander having disposed of his last dish-towel,
squinted at it through his half-closed eyes, like an
artist "sighting" a landscape, saw apparently that
it was in drawing, and next brought his vision to
bear on the back premises of his own dwelling,
where he saw there was no wifely figure in evidence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Sh-sh-h!" he said, creeping towards Mary, his
dull face transfigured with the consciousness that he
had news to tell. "Sh-sh—her brother&#39;s a rustler.
If &#39;twan&#39;t for her"—Leander went through the
grewsome pantomime of tying an imaginary rope
round his neck and throwing it over the limb of an
imaginary tree. "They&#39;re goin&#39; to get him for shore
<span class="tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span>
<a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this time, soon as he comes out of jail; but would
you guess it from her bluff?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There was no mistaking the fate of a rustler after
Mr. Dax&#39;s grisly demonstration, but of the quality
of his calling Mary was as ignorant as before.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"And why should they do that?" she inquired,
with tenderfoot simplicity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Stealin&#39; cattle ain&#39;t good for the health hereabouts,"
said Leander, as one who spoke with
authority. "It&#39;s apt to bring on throat trouble."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But Mary did not find Leander&#39;s joke amusing.
She had suddenly remembered the pale, gaunt man
who had walked into the eating-house the previous
morning and walked out again, his errand turned
into farce-comedy by the cowardice of an unworthy
antagonist. The pale man&#39;s grievance had had to
do with sheep and cattle. His name had been
Rodney, too. She understood now. He was Judith
Rodney&#39;s brother, and he was in danger of being
hanged. Mary Carmichael felt first the admiration
of a girl, then the pity of a woman, for the brave
young creature who so stoutly carried so unspeakable
a burden. But she could not speak of
her new knowledge to Leander.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She glanced towards this childlike person and
saw from his stealthy manner that he had more to
impart. He walked towards the kitchen door, saw
no one, and came back to Mary.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There ain&#39;t a man in this Gawd-forsaken country
wouldn&#39;t lope at the chance to die for her—but the
women!" Leander&#39;s pantomimic indication of absolute
feminine antagonism was conclusive.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span>
<a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The wimmin treats her scabby—just scabby.
Don&#39;t you go to thinkin&#39; she ain&#39;t a good girl on
that account"; and something like an attitude of
chivalrous protection straightened the apologetic
crook in his craven outline.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She&#39;s good, just good, and when a woman&#39;s that
there&#39;s no use in sayin&#39; it any more fanciful. As I
says to my wife, every time she give me a chance,
&#39;If Judy wasn&#39;t a good girl these boys about here
would just natchrally become extinct shootin&#39; each
other upon account of her.&#39; But she don&#39;t favor
none enough to cause trouble."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Are the women jealous of her?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It&#39;s her independence that riles &#39;em. They take
on awful about her ridin&#39; in pants, an&#39; it certainly
is a heap more modest than ridin&#39; straddle in a
hitched up caliker skirt, same as some of them do."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"And do all the women out here ride astride?"
Mary gasped.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"A good many does, when you ain&#39;t watchin&#39;;
horses in these parts ain&#39;t broke for no such lopsided
foolishness as side-saddles. But you see she
does it becomin&#39;, and that&#39;s where the grudge
comes in. You can&#39;t stir about these foot-hills without
coming across a woman, like as not, holdin&#39; on
to a posse of kids, and ridin&#39; clothes-pin fashion in a
looped-up skirt; when she sees you comin&#39; she&#39;ll
p&#39;r&#39;aps upset a kid or two assoomin&#39; a decorous
attitood. That&#39;s feemi<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">nine</span>, and as such is approved
by the ladies, but"—and here Leander put his head
on one side and gave a grotesque impression of outraged
decorum—"pants is considered unwomanly."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span>
<a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Leander! Leander!" came in accusing accents
from the kitchen.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Run!" gasped Mrs. Dax&#39;s handmaiden; "don&#39;t
let her catch us chinnin&#39;."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary Carmichael ran round one side of the house
as she was bidden, but, like Lot&#39;s wife, could not
resist the temptation of looking back. Leander,
with incredible rapidity, grabbed two clothes-pins
off the line, clutched a dish-towel, shook it. "Comin&#39;!
comin&#39;!" he called, as he went through the farce of
rehanging it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The lonesomeness of plain and foot-hill, the utter
lack of the human element that gives to this country
its character of penetrating desolation, had been
changed while Mary Carmichael forgathered with
Leander by the clothes-line. From the four quarters
of the compass, men in sombreros, flannel
shirts, and all manner of strange habiliments came
galloping over the roads as if their horses were as
keen on reaching Dax&#39;s as their riders. They came
towards the house at full tilt, their horses stretching
flat with ears laid back viciously, and Mary, who
was unused to the tricks of cow-ponies, expected to
see them ride through the front door, merely by way
of demonstrating their sense of humor. Not so; the
little pintos, buckskins, bays, and chestnuts dashed
to the door and stopped short in a full gallop; as a
bit of staccato equestrianism it was superb.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And then the wherefore of all this dashing horsemanship,
this curveting, prancing, galloping revival
of knightly tourney effects was apparent—Judith
Rodney had opened post-office. She had changed
<span class="tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span>
<a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
her riding clothes; or, rather, that portion of them to
which the ladies took exception was now concealed
by a long, black skirt. Her wonderful braids of
black hair had been twisted high on her head. She
was well worth a trip across the alkali wastes to
see. The room was packed with men. One unconsciously
got the impression that a fire, a fight, or
some crowd-collecting casualty had happened.
Above the continual clinking of spurs there arose
every idiom and peculiarity of speech of which these
United States are capable. There is no Western
dialect, properly speaking. Men bring their modes
of expression with them from Maine or Minnesota,
as the case may be, but their figures of speech, which
give an essential picturesqueness to their language,
are almost entirely local—the cattle and sheep
industries, prospecting, the Indians, poker, faro,
the dance-halls, all contribute their printable or unprintable
embellishment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith managed them all—cow-punchers, sheep-herders,
prospectors, freighters—with an impersonal
skill that suggested a little solitary exercise in the
bowling-alley. The ten-pins took their tumbles in
good part—no one could congratulate himself on
escaping the levelling ball—and where there&#39;s a
universal lack of luck, doubtless also there will be
found a sort of grim fellowship.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">That they were all more or less in love with her
there could be no doubt. As a matter of fact,
Judith Rodney did not depend on the scarcity of
women in the desert for her pre-eminence in the interests
of this hot-headed group. Her personality—and
<span class="tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span>
<a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
through no conscious effort of hers—would have
been pre-eminent anywhere. As it was, in this
woman-forsaken wilderness she might have stirred
up a modern edition of the Trojan war at any
moment. That she did not, despite the lurking
suggestion of temptation written all over her,
brought back the words of Leander: "If Judy
wasn&#39;t a good girl, these boys would just nacherally
become extinct shooting each other upon account
of her."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And yet what a woman she was! It struck Miss
Carmichael, as she watched Judith hold these warring
elements in the hollow of her hand, that her
interest might be due to a certain temperamental
fusion; that there might lie, at the essence of her
being, a subtle combination of saint and devil. One
could fancy her leading an army on a crusade or
provoking a bar-room brawl. The challenging
quality of her beauty, the vividness of color, the
suggestion of endurance and radiating health in
every line, were comparable to the great primeval
forces about her. She was cast to be the mother
of men of brawn and muscle, who would make this
vast, unclaimed wilderness subject to them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At present neither pole of her character, as it
had been hastily estimated, was even remotely
suggested. The atmosphere in the post-office was,
considering the potential violence of its visitors,
singularly calm. And Judith, feeding these wild
border lads on scraps of chaff and banter, and retaining
their absolute loyalty, was a sight worth
seeing. She had the alertness of a lion-tamer
<span class="tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span>
<a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
locked in a cage with the lords of the jungle; the
rashly confident she humbled, the meek she exalted,
and all with such genuine good-fellowship, such
an absence of coquetry in the genial game of give
and take, that one ceased to wonder at even the
devotion of Leander. And since they were to her,
on her own confession, but "spurs and sombreros,"
one wondered at the elaboration of the comedy, the
endless wire-pulling in the manipulation of these
most picturesque marionettes—until one remembered
the outlaw brother and felt that what she did
she did for him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You right shore there ain&#39;t a letter for me,
Miss Judith. My creditors are pretty faithful &#39;bout
bearing me in mind." It was the third time that
the big, shambling Texan who had been one of the
company at Mrs. Clark&#39;s eating-house had inquired
for mail, and seemed so embarrassed by his own
bulk that he moved cautiously, as if he might step
on a fellow-creature and maim him. Each time he
had asked for a letter he took his place at the end
of the waiting-line and patiently bided his time for
the chance of an extra word with the postmistress.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"They&#39;ve begun to lose hope, Texas."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She shuffled the letters impartially, as a goddess
dispensing fate, and barely glanced at the man who
had ridden a hundred and fifty miles across sand and
cactus to see her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s the difference between them and me."
There was a grim finality in his tone.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What, you&#39;re going to take your place at the end
of that line again! I&#39;ll try and find you a circular."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span>
<a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">He tried to look at her angrily, but she smiled
at him with such good-fellowship that he went off
singing significantly that universal anthem of the
cow-puncher the West over:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">"Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8em" class="tei tei-l">In a narrow grave just six by three,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8em" class="tei tei-l">Where the wild coyotes will howl o&#39;er me.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie."</p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ain&#39;t there a love letter for me?" The young
man who inquired seemed to belong to a different
race from these bronzed squires of the saddle. He
suggested over-crowded excursion boats on Sunday
afternoons in swarming Eastern cities. He buttonholed
every one and explained his presence in the
West on the score of his health, as though leaving
his native asphalt were a thing that demanded
apology.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes," answered the postmistress, with a real
motherly note, "here is one from Hugous &amp; Co."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A roar went up at this, and the blushing tenderfoot
pocketed his third bill for the most theatrical
style of Mexican sombrero; it had a brass snake
coiled round the crown for a hat-band, and a cow-puncher
in good and regular standing would have
preferred going bareheaded to wearing it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She seems to be pressing her suit, son; you
better name the day," one of the loungers suggested.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The blamed thing ain&#39;t worth twenty-five
dollars," the young man from the East declared.
A conspicuous silence followed. It seemed to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span>
<a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
irritate the owner of the hat that no one would
defend it. "It ain&#39;t worth it," he repeated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I think you allowed you was out here for your
health?" the big Texan, who had returned from
the corral, inquired.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Betcher life," swaggered the man with the hat,
"N&#39;York&#39;s good enough for me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But"—and the Texan smiled sweetly—"the
man who sold you the hat ain&#39;t out here for
his."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith hid her head and stamped letters. The
boys were suspiciously quiet, then some one began
to chant:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">"The devil examined the desert well,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">And made up his mind &#39;twas too dry for hell;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">He put up the prices his pockets to swell,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">And called it a—heal-th resort."</p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">The postmistress waited for the last note of the
chorus to die away, and read from a package she
held in her hand—"&#39;Mrs. Henry Lee, Deer Lodge,
Wyoming.&#39; Well, Henry, here&#39;s a wedding-present,
I guess. And my congratulations, though you&#39;ve
hardly treated us well in never saying a word."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The unfortunate Henry, who hadn&#39;t even a sweetheart,
and who was noted as the shyest man in the
"Goose Creek Outfit," had to submit to the mock
congratulations of every man in the room and
promise to set up the drinks later.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I never felt we&#39;d keep you long, son; them
golden curls seldom gets a chance to ripen singly."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Shoshone squaw, did you say she was, Henry?
<span class="tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span>
<a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
They ain&#39;t much for looks, but there&#39;s a heep of
wear to &#39;em."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, go on, now; you fellows know I ain&#39;t
married." And the boy handled the package with
a sort of dumb wonder, as if the superscription
were indisputable evidence of a wife&#39;s existence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Open it, Henry; you shore don&#39;t harbor sentiments
of curiosity regarding the post-office dealings
of your lady."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Now, old man, this here may be grounds for
divorce."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"See what the other fellow&#39;s sending your wife."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Henry, badgered, jostled, the target of many a
homely witticism, finally opened the package, which
proved to be a sample bottle of baby food. At
sight of it they howled like Apaches, and Henry was
again forced to receive their congratulations. Judith,
who had been an interested on-looker without joining
in the merriment, now detected in the tenor of
their humor a tendency towards breadth. In an instant
her manner was official; rapping the table with
her mailing-stamp, she announced:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Boys, this post-office closes in ten minutes, if
you want to buy any stamps."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The silence following this statement on the part
of the postmistress was instantaneous. Henry took
his mirth-provoking package and went his way; some
of the more hilariously inclined followed him. The
remainder confined themselves absolutely to business,
scrawling postal-cards or reading their mail.
The pounce of the official stamp on the letters, as
<span class="tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span>
<a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the postmistress checked them off for the mail-bag,
was the only sound in the hot stillness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A heavily built man, older than those who had
been keeping the post-office lively, now took advantage
of the lull to approach Judith. He had a
twinkling face, all circles and pouches, but it grew
graver as he spoke to the postmistress. He was
Major Atkins, formerly a famous cavalry officer, but
since his retirement a cattle-man whose herds grazed
to the pan-handle of Texas. As he took his mail,
talking meantime of politics, of the heat, of the lack
of water, in the loud voice for which he was famous,
he managed, with clumsy diplomacy, to interject a
word or two for her own ear alone.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Jim&#39;s out," he conveyed to her, in a successfully
muffled tone. "He&#39;s out, and they&#39;re after him,
hot. Get him out of the State, Judy—get him out,
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">quick</span>. He tried to kill Simpson at Mrs. Clark&#39;s, in
town, yesterday. The little Eastern girl that&#39;s here
will tell you." Then the major was gone before
Judith could perfectly realize the significance of
what he had told her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She threw back her head and the pulse in her
throat beat. Like a wild forest thing, at the first
warning sound, she considered: Was it time for
flight?—or was the warning but the crackling of a
twig? Major Atkins was a cattle-man: her brother
hated all cattle-men. How disinterested had been
the major&#39;s warning! He had always been her
friend. Mrs. Atkins had been one of the ladies at
the post who had helped to send her to school to
the nuns at Santa Fé. She despised herself for
<span class="tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span>
<a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
doubting; yet these were troublous times, and all
was fair between sheep and cattle-men. Major
Atkins had spoken of the Eastern girl; then that
pretty, little, curly-haired creature, whom Judith
had found standing in the sunshine, had seen Jim—had
heard him threaten to kill. Should she ask
her about it—consult her? Judith&#39;s training was not
one to impel her to give her confidence to strangers,
still she had liked the little Eastern girl.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">These were the perplexities that beset her, sweeping
her thoughts hither and thither, as sea-weed is
swept by the wash of the waves. She strove to collect
her faculties. How should she rid the house of
her cavaliers? She had regularly to refuse some half-dozen
of them each day that she kept post-office.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In a few minutes more the group in the post-office
began to disperse under the skilful manipulation
of the postmistress. To some she sold stamps
with an air of "God speed you," and they were
soon but dwindling specks on the horizon. To
others she implied such friendly farewells that there
was nothing to do but betake themselves to their
saddles. Others had compromised with the saloon
opposite, and their roaring mirth came in snatches
of song and shouts of laughter. She fastened up
the little pile of letters that had remained uncalled
for with what seemed a deliberate slowness. Each
time any one entered the room she looked up—then
the hope died hard in her face. Leander came in
with catlike tread and removed the pigeon-holes
from the table. The post-office was closed. Family
life had been resumed at the Daxes&#39;.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span>
<a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith left the room and stood in the blinding
sunlight, basking in it as if she were cold. The
mercury must have stood close to a hundred, and
she was hatless. There was no trace of her ebullient
spirits of the morning. Her head was sunk on her
breast and she held her hands with locked fingers
behind her. It was hot, hot as the breaths of a
thousand belching furnaces. A white, burning glare
had spread itself from horizon to horizon, and the
earth wrinkled and cracked beneath it. From
every corner of this parched wilderness came an
ominous whirring, like the last wheezing gasp of an
alarm-clock before striking the hour. This menacing
orchestration was nothing more or less than millions
of grasshoppers rasping legs and wings together in
hoarse appreciation of the heat and glare; but it
had a sound that boded evil. Again and again she
turned towards the yellow road as it dipped over
the hills; but there was never a glimpse of a horseman
from that direction.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">The Trail Of Sentiment</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Within the house the travellers had disposed
themselves in a repressed and melancholy
circle that suggested the suspended animation of a
funeral gathering. The fat lady had turned back
her skirt to save her travelling dress. The stage
was late, and there was no good and sufficient reason
for wearing it out. A similar consideration of
economy led her to flirt off flies with her second best
pocket-handkerchief. Mrs. Dax presided over the
gathering with awful severity. Every one truckled
to her shamefully, receiving her lightest remarks as
if they were to be inscribed on tablets of bronze.
Leander, his eyes bright with excitement at being
received in the family circle on an equal footing,
balanced perilously on the edge of his chair, anticipating
dismissal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Chugg&#39;s never ben so late as this," said Mrs.
Dax, rocking herself furiously. She strongly resembled
one of those mottled chargers of the nursery
whose flaunting nostrils seem forever on the
point of sending forth flame. Leander, the fat
lady, and Miss Carmichael meekly murmured assent
and condemnation.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span>
<a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"And there ain&#39;t a sign of him," said Mrs. Dax,
returning to the house after straining the landscape
through her all-observant eye, and not detecting him
in any of the remote pin-pricks on the horizon, in
which these plainsfolk invariably decipher a herd
of antelope, an elk or two, or a horseman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Bet he had a woman in the stage and upset it
with her," said Leander, in the animated manner
of a poor relation currying favor with a bit of news.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Dax regarded him severely for a moment,
then conspicuously addressed her next remark to
the ladies. "Bet he had a woman in the stage, the
old scoundrel!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Wonder who she was?" said Leander, with the
sparkling triumph of a poor relation whose surmise
had been accepted. But Mrs. Dax had evidently
decided that Leander had gone far enough.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Was you expectin&#39; any of your lady friends by
Chugg&#39;s stage that you are so frettin&#39; anxious?" she
inquired, and the poor relation collapsed miserably.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You&#39;ve heard about Chugg&#39;s goin&#39; on since
&#39;Mountain Pink&#39; jilted him?" inquired Mrs. Dax
of the fat lady, as the only one of the party who
might have kept abreast with the social chronicles
of the neighborhood.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"My land, yes," responded the fat lady, proud
to be regarded as socially cognizant. "M&#39; son says
he&#39;s plumb locoed about it—didn&#39;t want me to travel
by his stage. But I said he dassent upset a woman
of my age—he just nacherally dassent!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Miss Carmichael, by dint of patient inquiry, finally
got the story which was popularly supposed to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span>
<a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
account for the misdemeanors of the stage-driver,
including his present delinquency that was delaying
them on their journey.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It appeared that Lemuel Chugg, then writhing
in the coils of perverse romance, was among the
last of those famous old stage-drivers whose talents
combined skill at handling the ribbons with the
diplomacy necessary to treat with a masked envoy
on the road. His luck in these encounters was
proverbial, and many were the hair-breadth escapes
due to Chugg&#39;s ready wit and quick aim; and, to
quote Leander, "while he had been shot as full of
holes as a salt-shaker, there was a lot of fight in the
old man yet."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Chugg had had no loves, no hates, no virtues, no
genial vices after the manner of these frontiersmen.
Avarice had warmed the cockles of his heart, and the
fetish he prayed to was an old gray woollen stocking,
stuffed so full of twenty-dollar gold pieces that it
presented the bulbous appearance of the "before
treatment" view of a chiropodist&#39;s sign. This
darling of his old age had been waxing fat since
Chugg&#39;s earliest manhood. It had been his only
love—till he met Mountain Pink.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mountain Pink&#39;s husband kept a road-ranch
somewhere on Chugg&#39;s stage-route. She was of a
buxom type whose red-and-white complexion had
not yet surrendered to the winds, the biting dust,
and the alkali water. Furthermore, she could "bring
about a dried-apple pie" to make a man forget the
cooking of his mother. Great was the havoc wrought
by Mountain Pink&#39;s pies and complexion, but she
<span class="tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span>
<a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
followed the decorous precedent of Cæsar&#39;s wife, and,
like her pastry, remained above suspicion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Her husband, whose name was Jim Bosky, seemed,
to the self-impanelled jury that spent its time sitting
on the case, singularly insensible to his own advantages.
Not only did he fail to take a proper
pride in her beauty, but there were dark hints
abroad that he had never tasted one of her pies.
When delicately questioned on this point, at that
stage of liquid refreshment that makes these little
personalities not impossible, Bosky had grimly
quoted the dearth of shoes among shoe-makers&#39;
children.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Whatever were the facts of the case, Mountain
Pink got the sympathy that might have been expected
in a section of the country where the ratio
of the sexes is fifty to one. Chugg, eating her pies
regularly once a week on his stage-route, said
nothing, but he presented her with a red plush
photograph album with oxidized silver clasps, and
by this first reckless expenditure of money in the
life of Chugg, Natrona, Johnson, Converse, and Sweetwater
counties knew that Cupid had at last found
a vulnerable spot in the tough and weather-tanned
hide of the old stage-driver.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Nor did Cupid stop here with his pranks. Having
inoculated the stage-driver with the virus of romance,
madness began to work in the veins of
Chugg. He presented Mountain Pink with the
gray woollen stocking—not extracting a single coin—and
urged her to get a divorce from the clodlike
man who had never appreciated her and marry him.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span>
<a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mountain Pink coyly took the stocking so
generously given for the divorce and subsequent
trousseau, and Chugg continued to drive his stage
with an Apollo-like abandon, whistling love-songs
the while.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Coincident with Mountain Pink&#39;s disappearance
Dakotaward, in the interests of freedom, went also
one Bob Catlin, a mule-wrangler. Bosky, with conspicuous
pessimism, hoped for the worst from the
beginning, and as time went on and nothing was
heard of either of the wanderers, some of Mountain
Pink&#39;s most loyal adherents confessed it looked
"romancy." But crusty old Chugg remained true
to his ideal. "She&#39;ll write when she gets good and
ready," and then concluded, loyally, "Maybe she
can&#39;t write, nohow," and nothing could shake his
faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When Mountain Pink and the mule-wrangler returned
as bride and groom and set up housekeeping
on the remainder of Chugg&#39;s stocking, and on his
stage-route, too, so that he had to drive right past
the honeymoon cottage every time he completed
the circuit, they lost caste in Carbon County. Chugg
never spoke of the faithlessness of Mountain Pink.
His bitterness found vent in tipping over the stage
when his passengers were confined to members of
the former Mrs. Bosky&#39;s sex, and, as Leander said,
"the flask in his innerds held more." And these
were the only traces of tragedy in the life of Lemuel
Chugg, stage-driver.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith had continued her unquiet pacing in the
blinding glare while the group within doors, somnolent
<span class="tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span>
<a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the heat and the incessant shrilling of
the locusts, droningly discussed the faithlessness of
Mountain Pink, dozed, and took up the thread of
the romance. Each time she turned Judith would
stop and scan the yellow road, shading her eyes
with her hand, and each time she had turned away
and resumed her walk. Mary, who gave the postmistress
no unstinted share of admiration for the
courage with which she faced her difficulties, and
who had been seeking an opportunity to signify her
friendship, and now that she saw the last of the
gallants depart, inquired of Judith if she might
join her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They walked without speaking for several minutes,
enjoying a sense of comradeship hardly in keeping
with the brevity of their acquaintance; a freedom
from restraint spared them the necessity of exchanging
small-talk, that frequently irritating toll
exacted as tribute to possible friendship.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The desert lay white and palpitating beneath the
noonday glare, and from the outermost rim of desolation
came dancing "dust-devils" whirling and
gliding through the mazes of their eerie dance. "I
think sometimes," said Judith, "that they are the
ghosts of those who have died of thirst in the
desert."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary shuddered imperceptibly. "How do you
stand it with never a glimpse of the sea?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You&#39;ll love it, or hate it; the desert is too jealous
for half measures. As for the sea"—Judith
shrugged her fine shoulders—"from all I&#39;ve heard
of it, it must be very wet."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span>
<a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Each felt a reticence about broaching the subject
uppermost in her thoughts—Judith from the instinctive
tendency towards secretiveness that was
part of the heritage of her Indian blood; Mary because
the subject so closely concerned this girl for
whom she felt such genuine admiration.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith finally brought up the matter with an
abruptness that scarce concealed her anxiety.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You saw my brother yesterday at Mrs. Clark&#39;s
eating-house; will you be good enough to tell me just
what happened?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary related the incident in detail, Judith cross-examining
her minutely as to the temper of the
men at table towards Jim. Did she know if any
cattle-men were present? Did she hear where her
brother had gone?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary had heard nothing further after he had left
the eating-house; the only one she had talked to
had been Mrs. Clark, whose sympathy had been
entirely with Jim. Judith thanked her, but in
reality she knew no more now than she had heard
from Major Atkins.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith now stopped in their walk and stood
facing the road as it rolled over the foot-hills—a
skein of yellow silk glimmering in the sun. Then
Mary saw that the object spinning across it in the
distance, hardly bigger than a doll&#39;s carriage, was
the long-delayed stage. She spoke to the postmistress,
but apparently she did not hear—Judith
was watching the nearing stage as if it might bring
some message of life and death. She stood still,
and the drooping lines of her figure straightened,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span>
<a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
every fibre of her beauty kindled. She was like
a flame, paling the sunlight.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And presently was heard the uncouth music of
sixteen iron-shod hoofs beating hard from the earth
rhythmic notes which presently grew hollow and
sonorous as they came rattling over the wooden
bridge that spanned the creek.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Chugg!" exclaimed Leander, rushing to the door
in a tumult. There was something crucial in the
arrival of the delayed stage-driver. His delinquencies
had deflected the course of the travellers,
left them stranded in a remote corner of the wilderness;
but now they should again resume the thread
of things; Chugg&#39;s coming was an event.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Tain&#39;t Chugg, by God!" said Leander, impelled
to violent language by the unexpected.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It&#39;s Peter Hamilton!" exclaimed Mrs. Dax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Land&#39;s sakes, the New-Yorker!" said the fat
lady. Only Judith said nothing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mr. Hamilton held the ribbons of that battered
prairie-stage as if he had been driving past the
judges&#39; bench at the Horse Show. Furthermore, he
wore blue overalls, a flannel shirt, and a sombrero,
which sartorial inventory, while it highly became
the slim young giant, added an extra comedy touch
to his rôle of whip. He was as dusty as a miller;
close-cropped, curly head, features, and clothes were
covered with a fine alkali powdering; but he carried
his youth as a banner streaming in the blue. And
he swung from the stage with the easy flow of
muscle that is the reward of those who live in the
saddle and make a fine art of throwing the lariat.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span>
<a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">They greeted him heartily, all but Judith, who did
not trust herself to speak to him before the prying
eyes of Mrs. Dax, and escaped to the house. Chugg&#39;s
latest excursion into oblivion had resulted in a fall
from the box. He was not badly hurt, and recuperation
was largely a matter of "sleeping it off,"
concluded Peter Hamilton&#39;s bulletin of the condition
of the stage-driver. So the travellers were still
marooned at Dax&#39;s, and the prospect of continuing
their journey was as vague as ever.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Last I heard of you," said Mrs. Dax to Hamilton,
with a sort of stone-age playfulness, "you was
punching cows over to the Bitter Root."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s true, Mrs. Dax"—he gave her his most
winning smile—"but I could not stay away from
you long."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Leander grimaced and rubbed his hands in an
ecstasy of delight at finding a man who had the
temerity to bandy words with Mrs. Dax.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Hum-m-m-ph!" she whinnied, with equine
coquetry. "Guess it was rustlers brought you back
as much as me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith, who had entered the room in time to hear
Mrs. Dax&#39;s last remark, greeted him casually, but
her eyes, as they met his, were full of questioning
fear. Had he come from the Bitter Root range to
hunt down her brother? The thought was intolerable.
Yet, when he had bade her good-bye
some three weeks ago, he had told her that he did
not expect to return much before the fall "round-up."
She had heard, a day or two before, that he
was again in the Wind River country, and her morning
<span class="tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span>
<a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
vigil beneath the glare of the desert sun had
been for him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Dax regarded them with the mercilessness
of a death-watch; she remembered the time when
Hamilton&#39;s excuses for his frequent presence at the
post-office had been more voluble than logical. But
now he no longer came, and Judith, for all her
deliberate flow of spirits, did not quite convince
the watchful eyes of Leander&#39;s lady—the postmistress
was a trifle too cheerful.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Mrs. Dax," pleaded Peter, boyishly, "I&#39;m
perishing for a cup of coffee, and I&#39;ve got to get
back to my outfit before dark."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, go on with you," whinnied the gorgon; but
she left the room to make the coffee.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith&#39;s eyes sought his. "Why don&#39;t you and
Leander form a coalition for the overthrow of the
enemy?" His voice had dropped a tone lower than
in his parley with Mrs. Dax; it might have implied
special devotion, or it might have implied but the
passing tribute to a beautiful woman in a country
where women were few—the generic admiration
of all men for all women, ephemerally specialized
by place and circumstance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But Judith, harassed at every turn, heart-sick
with anxiety, had anticipated in Peter&#39;s coming, if
not a solution of her troubles, at least some evidence
of sustaining sympathy, and was in no mood for
resuscitating the perennial pleasantries anent
Leander and his masterful lady.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The shrilling of the locusts emphasized their
silence. She spoke to him casually of his change of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span>
<a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
plan, but he turned the subject, and Judith let the
matter drop. She was too simple a woman to
stoop to oblique measures for the gaining of her
own ends. If he was here to hunt down her brother,
if he was here to see the Eastern woman at the
Wetmore ranch—well, "life was life," to be taken
or left. Thus spoke the fatalism that was the
heritage of her Indian blood.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The thought of Miss Colebrooke at Wetmore&#39;s
reminded her of a letter for Peter that had been
brought that morning by one of the Wetmore cow-boys.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I forgot—there&#39;s a letter for you." She went to
the pigeon-holes on the wall that held the flotsam
and jetsam of unclaimed mail, and brought him a
square, blue linen envelope—distinctly a lady&#39;s
letter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter took it with rather a forced air of magnanimity,
as if in neglecting to present it to him sooner
she drew heavily on his reserve of patience. Tearing
open the envelope, he read it voraciously, read it to
the exclusion of his surroundings, the world at
large, and—Judith. He strode up and down the
floor two or three times, and called to Leander, who
was passing:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Dax, I must have that gray mare of yours right
away." He went in the direction of the stable,
without a second glance at the postmistress, and
presently they saw him galloping off in the opposite
direction from which he had come. Mrs. Dax came
in with a tray on which were a pot of coffee and
sundry substantial delicacies.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span>
<a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Where&#39;s he gone?" she demanded, putting the
tray down so hard that the coffee slopped.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I dunno," said Leander. "He said he&#39;d got to
have the gray mare, saddled her hisself, and rode
off like hell."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Dax looked at them all savagely for the
explanation that they could not give. In sending
her out to make coffee she felt that Peter, whom
she regarded in the light of a weakness, had taken
advantage of her affections to dupe her in regard
to his plans.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Take them things back to the kitchen," she
commanded Leander.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary Carmichael involuntarily glanced at Judith;
the fall of the leaf was in her cheek.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter Hamilton, bowed in his saddle and flogging
forward inhumanely, bred rife speculation as to
his destination among the group that watched him
from the Daxes&#39; front door. Mrs. Dax, who entertained
so profound a respect for her own omniscience
that she disdained to arrive at a conclusion
by a logical process of deduction, was "plumb certain
that he had gone after &#39;rustlers!&#39;" Leander, who
had held no opinions since his marriage except that
first and all-comprehensive tenet of his creed—that
his wife was a person to be loved, honored, and
obeyed instantly—agreed with his lady by a process
of reflex action. The fat lady, who had a commonplace
for every occasion, didn&#39;t "know what we were
all coming to." Miss Carmichael, who was beginning
to find her capacity for amazement overstrained,
alone accepted this last incident with apathy. Mr.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span>
<a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hamilton might have gone in swift pursuit of cattle
thieves or he might be riding the mare to death for
pure whimsy. Only Judith Rodney, who said nothing,
felt that he was spurring across the wilderness
at breakneck speed to see a girl at Wetmore&#39;s. But
her lack of comment caused no ripple of surprise in
the flow of loose-lipped speculation that served, for
the time being, to inject a casual interest into the
talk of these folk, bored to the verge of demoralization
by long waiting for Chugg.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith preferred to confirm her apprehensions regarding
Hamilton&#39;s ride, alone. She knew—had
not all her woman&#39;s intuitions risen in clamorous
warning—and yet she hoped, hoped despairingly,
even though the dread alternative to the girl at the
Wetmore ranch threatened lynch law for her brother.
Her very gait changed as she withdrew from the
group about the door, covertly gaining her vantage-ground
inch by inch. The heels of her riding-boots
made no sound as she stole across the kitchen floor,
toeing in like an Indian tracking an enemy through
the forest. The small window at the back of the
kitchen commanded a view of the road in all its
sprawling circumlocution. Seen from this prospect,
it had no more design than the idle scrawlings of
a child on a bit of paper; but the choice of roads
to Good and Evil was not fraught with more
momentous consequences than was each prong of
that fork towards which Hamilton was galloping.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The right arm swung towards the Wetmore ranch,
where at certain times during the course of the year
a hundred cow-punchers reported on the stock that
<span class="tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span>
<a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grazed in four States. At certain seasons, likewise,
despite the fact that the ranch was well into the
foot-hill country, there might be found a New York
family playing at life primeval with the co-operation
of porcelain bath-tubs, a French <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">chef</span>, and electric
light.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The left fork of the road had a meaner destiny.
It dipped straight into desolation, penetrating a naked
wilderness where bad men skulked till the evil
they had done was forgotten in deeds that called
afresh to Heaven for vengeance. It was well away
on this west fork of the road that they lynched
Kate Watson—"Cattle Kate"—for the crime of loyalty.
It was she, intrepid and reckless, who threatened
the horde of masked scoundrels when they came
to lynch her man for the iniquity of raising a few
vegetables on a strip of ground that cut into their
grazing country. And when she, recognizing them,
masked though they were, threatened them with
the vengeance of the law, they hanged her with her
man high as Haman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith watched Hamilton with narrowing eyes.
And now she was all Indian, the white woman in
her dead. Only the Sioux watched, and, in the
patient, Indian style, bided its time. "Cattle
thieves," "the girl at Wetmore&#39;s"—the words sang
themselves in her head like an incantation. "Cattle
thieves" meant her brother, their recognized leader—her
brother, who was dearer to her than the heart
in her breast, the eye in her head, the right hand
that held together the shambling, uncertain destiny
of her people. Would he turn to the left, Justice,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span>
<a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on a pale horse, hunting her brother gallowsward?
Would he turn towards the right, the impetuous
lover spurring his steed that he might come swiftly
to the woman. A pulse in her bosom rose slowly
until her breath was suspended, then fell again;
she was still watching, without an outward quiver,
long after he had turned to the right—and the
woman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith knew that the name of the girl whose
letter sent Peter Hamilton vaulting to the saddle
was Katherine Colebrooke. There had been a deal
of letter-writing between her and the young cow-puncher
of late, of which perforce, by a singular
irony of fate, the postmistress had been the involuntary
instrument. The correspondence had
followed a recent hasty journey to New York, undertaken
somewhat unwillingly by Hamilton in the interest
of certain affairs connected with the settlement
of an estate.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The precipitancy of this latest turn of events
bewildered Judith; but yet a little while—a matter
of weeks and days—and her friendship with Hamilton
had been of that pleasantly indefinite estate
situated somewhere on the borderland of romance,
a kingdom where there is no law but the mutual
interest of the wayfarers. Judith and Peter had
been pitifully new at the game of life when the gods
vouchsafed them the equivocal blessing of propinquity.
Judith was but lately come from the
convent at Santa Fé, and Hamilton from the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span>
<a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
university whose honors availed him little in the
trailing of cattle over the range or in the sweat and
tumult of the branding-pen. It was a strange
election of opportunity for a man who had been
class poet and had rather conspicuously avoided
athletics during his entire college course. In
pursuing fortune westward Hamilton did not lack
for chroniclers who would not have missed a good
story for the want of an authentic dramatic interpretation
of his plans. His uncle, said they, who
had put him through college, was disposed to let
him sink or swim by his own efforts; or, again, he
had quarrelled with this same omnipotent uncle
and walked from his presence with no prospects but
those within grasp of his own hand. Again, he had
taken the negative of a fair lady more to heart than
two-and-twenty is in the habit of taking negatives.
Peter made no confidences. He went West to punch
cows for the Wetmore outfit; he was a distant connection
of the Wetmores through his mother&#39;s side
of the family.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In those days Peter wore his rue—whether for
lady fair or for towering prospects stricken down—with
a tinge of wan melancholy not unbecoming
to a gentle aquilinity of profile, softened by the
grace of adolescence. His instinctive aristocracy
of manners and taste would have availed him little
with his new associates had he been a whit less
manly. But as he shirked no part of the universal
hardship, they left him his reticence. He even
came to enjoy a sort of remote popularity as one
who was conversant with the best—a nonchalant
<span class="tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span>
<a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
social connoisseur—yet who realized the stern
primitive beauties of the range life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith&#39;s convent upbringing had conferred on
her the doubtful advantage of a gentlewoman&#39;s
tastes and bearing, making of her, therefore, an
alien in her father&#39;s house. When Mrs. Atkins,
who was responsible for her education, realized
the equivocal good of these things, and saw moreover
that the girl had grown to be a beauty, she
offered to adopt her; but Judith, with the pitiful
heroism of youth that understands little of what it
is renouncing, thought herself strong enough to hold
together a family, uncertain of purpose as quicksilver.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In those tragic days of readjustment came Peter
Hamilton, as strange to the bald conditions of
frontier life as the girl herself. From the beginning
there had been between them the barrier of circumstance.
Hamilton was poor, Judith the mainstay
of a household whose thriftlessness had become
a proverb. He came of a family that numbered a
signer of the Declaration of Independence, a famous
chief-justice, and the dean of a great university;
Judith was uncertain of her right to the very name
she bore. And yet they were young, he a man,
she a woman—eternal fountain of interest. A
precocious sense of the fitness of things was the
compass that enabled Peter to steer through the
deep waters in the years that followed. But the
girl paid the penalty of her great heart; in that
troublous sea of friendship, she was soon adrift
without rudder, sail, or compass.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span>
<a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith was now eight-and-twenty, and a sculptor
would have found a hundred statues in her. Long
of limb, deep-bosomed, youth and health radiated
from her as sparks fly upward. In sunlight, her
black hair had the bluish iridescence of a ripe plum.
The eyes were deep and questioning—the eyes of
a young seraph whose wings had not yet brushed
the far distant heights of paradise. Again, in her
pagan gladness of living, she might have been a
Valkyr come down from Valhalla on a shooting-star.
And yet, in this wilderness that was famishing for
woman&#39;s love and tears and laughter, by a very
perversity of fate she walked alone.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She was a true daughter of the desert, the child
of stark, unlovely circumstance. No well-bred romance
of book and bells and churchly benediction
had ushered her into being. Her maternal grandfather
had been the famous Sioux chief, Flying
Hawk; her grandmother, a white woman, who knew
no word of her people&#39;s tongue, nor yet her name or
race. The Indians found the white baby sleeping
by her dead mother after the massacre of an emigrant
train. They took her with them and she grew up,
in the Black Hill country, a white-skinned Sioux,
marrying a chief of the people that had slain her
people. She accepted her squaw&#39;s portion uncomplainingly;
slaved cheerfully at squaw&#39;s work while
her brave made war on the whites, hunted, and
smoked. She reared her half-breed children in the
legends of their father&#39;s people, and died, a withered
crone, cursing the pale-faces who had robbed the
Sioux of the buffalo and their hunting-ground.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span>
<a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Her daughter, Singing Stream, who knew no word
of English, but who could do better bead-work than
any squaw in the tribe, went to live with Warren
Rodney when he finished his cabin on Elder Creek.
That was before the gold fever reached the Black
Hills, and Rodney built the cabin that he might
fish and hunt and forget the East and why he left
it. There were reasons why he wanted to forget his
identity as a white man in his play at being an Indian.
In the first flare of youth and the joy of
having come into her woman&#39;s kingdom, the half-breed
squaw was pretty; she was proud, too, of her
white man, the house he had built her, and the girl
pappoose with blue eyes. Furthermore, she had
been taught to serve man meekly, for he was the
lord of creation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Rodney talked Sioux to her. He had all but
forgotten he was a white man. The girl pappoose
ran about the cabin, brown and bare, but for the
bead jacket Singing Stream had made for her in the
pride of her maternity. Rodney called the little
girl "Judith." Her Indian mother never guessed
the significance of the strange name that she could
not say, but made at least ten soft singing syllables
of, in the Indian way. The little Judith greeted her
father in strange lispings; Warren Rodney was far
from unhappy in playing at primitive man. This
recessional into conditions primeval endured for
"seven snows," as the Indian tongue hath it. Then
the squaw began to break, after the manner of
the women of her father&#39;s people. She had begun
her race with time a decade after Warren
<span class="tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span>
<a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Rodney, and she had outdistanced him by a decade.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And then the Tumlins came from Tennessee to
the Black Hills. They came in an ox-cart, and the
days of their journey were more than two years.
They had stopped in Ohio, and again in Illinois;
and, behold! neither was the promised land, the
land that their excited imaginations had painted
from the large talk of returning travellers, and that
was further glorified through their own thriftless
discontent with conditions at home. They had
travelled on and on across half a continent in the
wake of a vanishing sky-line. The vague westward
impulse was luring them to California, but they
waited in Dakota that their starved stock might
fatten, and while they rested themselves from the
long journey, Warren Rodney made the acquaintance
of Sally Tumlin, who rallied him on being a
"squaw man."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Warren Rodney had almost forgotten the sorceries
of the women of his people; he had lived so long
with a brown woman, who spread no silken snares.
Sally&#39;s blushes stirred a multitude of dead things—the
wiles of pale women, all strength in weakness,
fragile flowers for tender handling—the squaw had
grown as withered as a raisin.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Now, Sally Tumlin had no convictions about life
but that the world owed her "a home of her own."
Her mother had forged the bolt of this particular
maxim at an early date. And Sally saw from
precocious observation that the business of women
was home-getting, to which end they must be neat
<span class="tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span>
<a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and sweet and sparing of speech. After the home
was forthcoming, then, indeed, might a woman take
ease in slippers and wrapper, and it is surely a wife&#39;s
privilege to speak her mind. Sally knew that she
hated travelling westward after the crawling oxen;
each day the sun pursued them, caught up with
them, outdistanced them, and at night left them
stranded in the wilderness, and rose again and
mocked them on the morrow. Her father and
oafish brother loved the makeshifts of the wagon
life, with its chance shots at fleeing antelope, scurrying
sage-hens, and bounding cotton-tails; a chance
parley with a stray Indian but added zest to the
game of chance. But Sally hated it all. The cabin
on Elder Creek had a tight roof; Warren Rodney
had money in the bank. He had had uncommon
luck at trapping. His talk to Sally was largely of
his prospects.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Sally knew that the world owed her "a home of
her own"; and why should she let a squaw keep her
from it? Sally&#39;s mother giggled when consulted.
She plainly regarded the squaw as a rival of her
daughter. The ethics of the case, as far as Mrs.
Tumlin was concerned, was merely a question of
white skin against brown, and which should carry
the day. Singing Stream knew not one word of
the talk, much of which occurred in her very
presence, that threatened to pull her home about
her ears, but she knew that Sally was taking her
man from her. The white-skinned woman wore
white ruffles about her neck and calico dresses that
were the color of the wild roses that grew among
<span class="tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span>
<a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the willows at the creek. Sally Tumlin&#39;s pink
calico gowns sowed a crop of nettles in the mind of
the squaw. It was the rainbow things, she felt,
that were robbing her of her man. All her barbaric
craving for glowing colors asserted itself as a means
towards the one great end of keeping him. Singing
Stream began to scheme schemes. One day
Rodney was splitting wood at the Tumlin camp—though
why he should split wood where there were
two women puzzled the squaw. But the ways of
the pale-faces were beyond her ken. She only
knew that she must make herself beautiful in the
eyes of Warren Rodney, like this devil woman, and
then perhaps the pappoose that she expected with
the first snowfall would be a man-child; and she
hoped great things of this happening.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">With such primitive reasoning did Singing Stream
put the horses to the light wagon, and, taking the
little Judith with her, drove to Deadwood, a matter
of two hundred miles, to buy the bright calicoes that
were to make her like a white woman. It never
occurred to the half-breed woman to make known
her plans to Warren Rodney. In circumventing
Sally Tumlin the man became the spoils of war, and
it is not the Indian way to tell plans on the war-trail.
So the squaw left her kingdom in the hands
of the enemy, without a word.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Sally Tumlin and Warren Rodney looked upon
the disappearance of the squaw in the light of a
providential solution of the difficulties attending
their romance. They admitted it was square of
her to "hit the trail," and they decided to lose no
<span class="tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span>
<a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
time in going to the army post, where a chaplain,
an Indian missionary, happened to be staying at
the time, and have a real wedding, with a ring and
a fee to the parson. The wedding party started
for the post, old mother Tumlin fluttering about
the bride as complacently as if the ceremony had
been the culmination of the most decorous courtship.
The oafish brother drove the bridal party, making
crude jests by-the-way, to the frank delight of the
prospective groom and the giggling protestations
of the bride. The chaplain at the post was disposed
to ask few questions. Parsons made queer marriages
in those tumultuous days, and it was regarded
as a patent of worthy motives that the pair should
call in the man of the gospel at all. To the question
whether or not he had been married before, Rodney
answered:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, parson, this is the first time I have ever
stood up for a life sentence." And the ceremony
proceeded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Some of the ladies at the post, hearing that there
was to be a wedding, dropped in and added their
smiles and flutterings to the rather grim party;
among them, Mrs. Atkins, who had just come to
the post as a bride. They even added a trifle or two
from their own store of pretty things, as presents to
Sally. And Miss Tumlin left the post Mrs. Warren
Rodney, with "a home of her own" to go to.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Singing Stream did not hasten in her quest for
bright fabrics with which to stay the hand of fate.
To the half-breed woman the journey to town was
not without a certain revivifying pleasure. The Indian
<span class="tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span>
<a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in her stirred to the call of the open country.
The tight roof to the cabin on Elder Creek had not
the attractions for her that it had for Sally Tumlin.
She had chafed sometimes at a house with four walls.
But now the dead and gone braves rose in her as
she followed the old trail where they had so often
crept to battle against their old enemies, the Crows,
before the white man&#39;s army had scattered them.
And as she drove through the foot-hill country, she
told the solemn-eyed little Judith the story of the
Sioux, and what a great fighting people they had
been before Rodney&#39;s people drove them from their
land. Judith was holding a doll dressed exactly
like herself, in soft buckskin shirt, little trousers, and
moccasins, all beautifully beaded. In her turn she
told the story to the doll.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Singing Stream told her daughter of the making
of the world, as the Sioux believe the story of
creation; of the "Four who Never Die"—Sharper,
or Bladder, Rabbit, Turtle, and Monster; likewise
of the coming of a mighty flood on which swam the
Turtle and a water-fowl in whose bill was the earth
atom, from which presently the world began to
grow, Turtle supporting the bird on his great
back, which was hard like rock. The rest of the
myth, that deals with the rising and setting of the
sun, Singing Stream could not tell her daughter, as
the old Sioux chiefs did not think it wise to let their
women folk know too much about matters of
theology. Nor did they relate to squaws the sun
myth, with its account of much cutting-off of heads—thinking,
perhaps, with wisdom, that these good
<span class="tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span>
<a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ladies saw enough of carnage in their every-day life
without introducing it into their catechism.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But Singing Stream knew the story of "Sharper,"
or "Bladder," as he is called by some of the
people, because he is round and his grotesquely fat
figure resembles a bladder blown to bursting. Bladder&#39;s
province it is to make a fool of himself,
diving into water after plums he sees reflected
there from the branches of the trees. He dives
again and again in his pursuit of folly, even tying
stones to his wrists and ankles to keep himself
down while he gathers the reflected fruit. After
his rescue, which he fights against valiantly, as he
lies gasping on the bank of the stream, he sees the
fruit on the branches above his head. It is this
same Bladder who is one of the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">dramatis personæ</span>
in the moon myth, and that is told to women as
safely without the limits of that little learning that
is a dangerous thing. Bladder met Rabbit hunting;
and Bladder kept throwing his eye up into the
tree-tops to look for game. The Rabbit watched
him enviously, thinking what a saving of effort it
would be if he could do the same thing. Wherefore
Bladder promised to instruct him, telling him to
change eyes after using one four times, but Rabbit
did not think that the first time counted, as that
was but a trial. So he lost his eye after throwing
it up the fifth time. And the eye of the rabbit is
the moon, and the face seen in the full moon is the
reflection of the rabbit seen in his own eye as we
see ourselves reflected in the eye of a friend if we
look closely. The little girl was wonderfully impressed.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span>
<a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
She put her hand to her own eyes, but they
were in tight, too tight to throw up to the tree-tops.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Singing Stream also told little Judith that the
Great Mystery had shown truths, hid to man, to the
trees, the streams, the hills; and the clouds that
shaped themselves, drifting hither and yon, were
the Great Mystery&#39;s passing thoughts. But he had
deprived all these things of speech, as he did not
trust them fully, and they could only speak to man
in dreams, or in some passing mood, when they
could communicate to him the feeling of one of the
Great Spirits, and warn man of what was about
to befall him. Judith was not quite four when she
took this memorable drive with her mother, but the
impression of these things abided through all her
years. It was to the measureless spaces of desert
loneliness that she learned to bring her sorrows in
the days of her arid youth, and to feel a kinship
with all its moods and to hear in the voice of its
silence a never-failing consolation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And when they had come within a mile of Warren
Rodney&#39;s cabin on Elder Creek, Singing Stream
halted and prepared for the great event of reinstatement.
First she made a splendid toilet of purple
calico torn into strips and tied about the waist to
simulate the skirts of the devil woman. Over these
she wore a shirt of buckskin, broidered with beads
of many colors, and a necklace of elk teeth, wound
twice about the throat. On her feet she wore new
moccasins of tanned elk-hide, and these, too, were
beaded in many colors. Her hair, now braided with
strips of scarlet flannel, hung below the waist. And
<span class="tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span>
<a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
she walked to Rodney&#39;s cabin, not as an outgrown
mistress, but as the daughter of a chief. The little
Judith held up her head and clung tight to the doll.
She knew that something of moment was about to
happen.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The gala trio, Singing Stream, Judith, and Judith&#39;s
doll, presented themselves at Rodney&#39;s house, before
which the bride was washing clothes, the day being
fine. Sally, as usual, wore one of the rose-colored
calicoes with the collar turned well in and the sleeves
rolled above the elbows. She washed vigorously,
with a steady splashing of suds. Sally enjoyed this
home of her own and all the household duties
appertaining to it. She was singing, and a strand
of pale-brown hair, crinkly as sea-weed, had blown
across the rose of her cheek, when she felt rather
than saw a shadow fall across her path, and, glancing
up, she saw facing her the woman whom she
had supplanted, and the solemn-eyed little girl
holding tight to her doll. Now, neither woman
knew a word of the other&#39;s speech, but Sally was
proficient in the language of femininity, and she was
not at a loss to grasp the significance of the purple
calico, the beaded buckskin shirt, and the necklace
of elk teeth. The half-breed walked as a chief&#39;s
daughter to the woman at the tub, and Sally grew
sick and chill despite her white skin and the gold
ring that made Warren Rodney her man in the face
of the law. The dark woman held Judith proudly
by the hand, as a sovereign might carry a sceptre.
Judith was her staff of office, her emblem of authority
in the house of Warren Rodney.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span>
<a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Singing Stream held out her hands to Sally
in a gesture of appeal—and blundered. Of the
chief&#39;s daughter, walking proudly, Sally was afraid;
but a supplicating half-breed in strips of purple
calico, not even hemmed, was a matter for merriment.
Sally put her hands on her hips, arms
akimbo, and laughed a dry cackle. The light in
the brown woman&#39;s eyes, as she looked at the white,
was like prairie-fires rolling forward through darkness.
There was no need of a common speech between
them. The whole destiny of woman was in
the laugh and the look that answered it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And the man they could have murdered for came
from the house, an unheroic figure with suspenders
dangling and a corncob pipe in his mouth, sullen,
angry, and withal abjectly frightened, as mere man
inevitably is when he sniffs a woman&#39;s battle in the
air. The bride, at sight of her husband, took to
hysterics. She wept, she laughed, and down tumbled
her hair. She felt the situation demanded a scene.
Rodney, with a marital brevity hardly to be expected
so soon, commanded Sally to go into the
house and to "shut up."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then he faced Singing Stream and said to her in
her own language: "You must go away from here.
The pale-faced woman is my wife by the white man&#39;s
law—ring and Bible. No Indian marriage about
this."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But the brown woman only pointed to Judith.
She asked Rodney had she not been a good squaw
to him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And Rodney, who at best was but a poltroon,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span>
<a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
could only repeat: "You got to keep away from
here. It&#39;s the white man&#39;s law—one squaw for
one man."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">From within came the sound of Sally&#39;s lamentation
as she called for her father and brother to take
her from the squaw and contamination. Warren
Rodney was a man of few words. It had become
his unpleasant duty to act, and to act quickly. He
snatched Judith from her mother and took her into
the house, and he returned with his Winchester,
which was not loaded, to Singing Stream.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You got to go," he said, and levelling the
Winchester, he repeated the command. Singing
Stream looked at him with the dumb wonder of a
forest thing. "I was a good squaw to you," she
said; and did not even curse him. And turning, she
ran towards the foot-hills, with all the length of purple
calico trailing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Now Mrs. Rodney, <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">née</span> Tumlin, was but human,
and her cup of happiness as the wife of a "squaw
man" was not the brimming beaker she had anticipated.
The expulsion of her predecessor, at such
a time, to make room for her own home-coming,
was, it seemed, open to criticism. "The neighborhood"—it
included perhaps five families living in a
radius of as many hundred miles—felt that the
Tumlins had established a bad precedent. A "squaw
man" driving out a brown wife to make room for a
white is not a heroic figure. It had been done before,
but it would not hand down well in the traditions of
the settling of this great country. Trespass of law
and order, with their swift, red-handed reckoning,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span>
<a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were but moves of the great game of colonization.
But to shove out a brown woman for a white was
a mean move. Few stopped at the Rodneys&#39; ranch,
though it marked the first break in the journey
from town to the gold-mining country. Rodney
had fallen from his estate as a pioneer; his political
opinions were unsought in the conclaves that sat
and spat at the stove, when business brought them
to the joint saloon and post-office. The women dealt
with the question more openly, scorning feminine
subtlety at this pass as inadequate ammunition.
When they met Mrs. Rodney they pulled aside their
skirts and glared. This outrage against woman it
was woman&#39;s work to settle.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Rodney, who had no more moral sense than
a rabbit, felt that she was the victim of persecution.
She knew she was a good woman. Hadn&#39;t she a
husband? Had there ever been a word against her
character? What was the use of making all that
fuss over a squaw? It was not as if she was a white
woman. The injustice of it preyed on the former
Miss Tumlin. She took to the consolations of snuff-dipping
and fell from her pink-and-white estate.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The Tumlin family did not remain long enough
in the Black Hill country to witness Sally&#39;s failure
as the wife of a pioneer. The restlessness of the
"settler," if the paradox be permissible, was in the
marrow of their bones. The makeshifts of the
wagon, the adventures of the road, were the only
home they craved. The spring after Sally&#39;s marriage
they set forth for California, the year following for
New Mexico, and still sighed for new worlds to visit.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span>
<a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
They were happier now that Sally, the one element
of discontent, had been removed from their perennial
journeying by the merciful dispensation of marriage.
Old Tumlin, his wife, and the son gave themselves
up more than ever to the day-dreams of the road,
the freedom of the open country, and the spirit of
adventure.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Rodney&#39;s squaw wife was taken in by some
neighbors, good folk who were conversant with all
phases of the romance. They stood by her in her
hour of trial, and afterwards continued to keep her
as a servant. Her son Jim grew up with their own
children. When he was four years of age his
mother, Singing Stream, died, and Sally persuaded
her husband to take young Jim into their own
home, partly as a sop to neighborly criticism, partly
as a salve to her own conscience. Sally had children
of her own, and looked at things differently now
from the time when she fought the squaw for
Rodney&#39;s favor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Jim&#39;s foster-parents were, in truth, glad to part
with him. From his earliest babyhood he had been
known as a "limb of Satan." He was an Ishmael
by every instinct of his being. And Mrs. Warren
Rodney, <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">née</span> Tumlin, felt that in dealing with him,
in her capacity of step-mother, she daily expiated any
offence that she might have done to his mother.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Sally grew slatternly with increasing maternity.
She spent her time in a rocking-chair, dipping snuff—a
consolation imported from her former home—and
lamenting the bad marriage she had made.
Rodney ascribed his ill-fortune to unjust neighborly
<span class="tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span>
<a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
criticism. He farmed a little, he raised a little
stock, and he drank a great deal of whiskey. Sally
hated the Black Hill country. She felt that it
knew too much about her. The neighborly inquisition
had fallen like a blight on the family
fortunes. A vague migratory impulse was on her.
She wanted to go somewhere and begin all over
again. By dint of persistent nagging she persuaded
her husband to move to Wyoming, then in the
golden age of the cattle industry. Those were days
when steers, to speak in the cow language, had
"jumped to seventy-five." The wilderness grew
light-headed with prosperity. Wonderful are the
tales still told about those fat years in cattle-land.
It was in those halcyon days of the Cheyenne Club
that the members rode from the range, white with
the dust of the desert, to enjoy greater luxuries than
those procurable at their clubs in New York.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Nor was it all feasting and merrymaking. A
heroic band it was that battled with the wilderness,
riding the range with heat and cold, starvation and
death, and making small pin-pricks in that empty
blotch of the United States map that is marked
"Great Alkali Desert" blossom into settlements.
When the last word has been said about the pioneers
of these United States, let the cow-boy be remembered
in the universal toast, that bronzed son of the
saddle who lived his little day bravely and merrily,
and whose real heroism is too often forgotten in the
glamour of his own picturesqueness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith was ten years old when her father, his
wife, and their children moved from Dakota—they
<span class="tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span>
<a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were not so particular about North and South
Dakota, in those days—to take up a claim on
Sweetwater, Wyoming. Judith gave scant promise
of the beauty that in later life became at once her
dower and her misfortune, that which was as likely
to bring wretchedness as happiness. In Wyoming
she was destined to find an old friend, Mrs. Atkins,
who, as the bride of the young lieutenant, had been
present at the marriage of Sally Tumlin and Warren
Rodney, and who had always felt a wholly unreasonable
sense of guilt at witnessing the ceremony
and contributing a lace handkerchief to the bride.
Her husband, now Major Atkins, was stationed at
Fort Washakie, Wyoming. Mrs. Atkins happening
again on the Rodney family, and her husband having
increased and multiplied his army pay many
times over by a successful venture in cattle, the
scheme of Judith&#39;s convent education was put
through by the major&#39;s wife, who had kept her New
England conscience, the discomforts of frontier posts
notwithstanding.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">So Judith went to the nuns to school, and stayed
with them till she was eighteen. Mrs. Atkins would
have adopted her then; but Judith by this time
knew her family history in all its sordid ramifications,
and felt that duty called her to her brother, who
had not improved his unfortunate start in life,
though his step-mother did not spoil him for the
staying of the rod.</p>

<a name="toc_8" id="toc_8"></a>
<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">Chugg Takes The Ribbons</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Chugg, comforted with liquids and stayed with
a head-plaster, presented himself at the Dax
ranch just twenty-four hours after he was due.
His mien combined vagueness with hostility, and
he harnessed up the stage that Peter Hamilton had
driven over the day before, when his prospective
passengers were looking, with a graphic pantomimic
representation of "take it or leave it." Under the
circumstances, Miss Carmichael and the fat lady consented
to be passengers with much the same feeling
of finality that one might have on embarking for
the planet Mars in an air-ship.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There was, furthermore, a suggestion of last rites
in the farewells of the Daxes, each according to their
respective personalities, that was far from reassuring.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Here&#39;s some bread and meat and a bottle of cold
coffee, if you live to need it," was Mrs. Dax&#39;s grim
prognostication of accident. Leander, being of an
emotional nature, could scarce restrain his tears—the
advent of the travellers had created a welcome
variation in the monotony of his dutiful routine—he
felt all the agitation of parting with life-long
<span class="tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span>
<a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
friends. Mary Carmichael and Judith promised
to write—they had found a great deal to say to each
other the preceding evening.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Chugg cracked his whip ominously, the travellers
got inside, not daring to trust themselves to the box.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The journey with the misanthrope was but a
repetition of that first day&#39;s staging—the sage-brush
was scarcer, the mountains seemed as far off
as ever, and the outlook was, if possible, more
desolate. The entry in Miss Carmichael&#39;s diary,
inscribed in malformed characters as the stage jolted
over ruts and gullies, reads: "I do not mind telling
you, in strictest confidence, &#39;Dere Diary&#39;—as the
little boy called you—that when I so lightly severed
my connection with civilization, I had no idea to
what an extent I was going in for the prairie
primeval. How on earth does a woman who can
write a letter like Mrs. Yellett stand it? And where
on the map of North America is Lost Trail?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Land sakes!" regretted the fat lady, "but I do
wish I had a piece of that &#39;boy&#39;s favorite&#39; cake that
I had for my lunch the day we left town. I just
ate and ate it &#39;cause I hadn&#39;t another thing to do.
If I hadn&#39;t been so greedy I could offer him a piece,
just to show him that some women folk have kind
hearts, and that the whole sect ain&#39;t like that
Pink."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Boy&#39;s favorite," as adequate compensation for
shattered ideals, a broken heart, and the savings
of a lifetime, seemed to Mary Carmichael inadequate
compensation, but she forbore to express her sentiments.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span>
<a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">The fat lady had never relaxed her gaze from
Chugg&#39;s back since the stage had started. She
peered at that broad expanse of flannel shirt through
the tiny round window, like a careful sailing-master
sweeping the horizon for possible storm-clouds. At
every portion of the road presenting a steep decline
she would prod Chugg in the back with the handle
of her ample umbrella, and demand that he let
her out, as she preferred walking. The stage-driver
at first complied with these requests, but when he
saw they threatened to become chronic, he would
send his team galloping down grade at a rate to
justify her liveliest fears.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Do you think you are a-picnicking, that you
crave roominating round these yere solitoodes?"
And the misanthrope cracked his whip and adjured
his team with cabalistic imprecations.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Did you notice if Mrs. Dax giv&#39; him any cold
coffee, same as she did us?" anxiously inquired the
fat lady from her lookout.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary hadn&#39;t noticed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He&#39;s drinking something out of a brown bottle—seems
to relish it a heep more&#39;n he would cold
coffee," reported the watch. "Hi there! Hi! Mr.
Chugg!" The stage-driver, thinking it was merely
a request to be allowed to walk, continued to drive
with one hand and hold the brown bottle with the
other. But even his too solid flesh was not proof
against the continued bombardment of the umbrella
handle.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Um-m-m," he grunted savagely, applying a
watery eye to the round window.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span>
<a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nothing," answered the fat lady, quite satisfied
at having her worst fears confirmed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Chugg returned to his driving, as one not above
the weakness of seeing and hearing things.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Tain&#39;t coffee."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Could you smell it?" questioned Mary, anxiously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You never can tell that way, when they are
plumb pickled in it, like him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then how did you know it wasn&#39;t coffee?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"His eyes had fresh watered."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary collapsed under this expert testimony.
"What are we going to do about it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Appeal to him as a gentleman," said the fat
lady, not without dramatic intonation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You appeal," counselled Mary; "I saw him look
at you admiringly when you were walking down
that steep grade."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Is that so?" said the fat lady, with a conspicuous
lack of incredulity; and she put her hand involuntarily
to her frizzes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This time she did not trust to the umbrella-handle
as a medium of communication between the stage-driver
and herself. Putting her hand through the
port-hole she grasped Chugg&#39;s arm—the bottle arm—with
no uncertain grip.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why, Mr. Chugg, this yere place is getting to be
a regular summer resort; think of two ladies trusting
themselves to your protection and travelling out
over this great lonesome desert."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Chugg&#39;s mind, still submerged in local Lethe
waters, grappled in silence with the problem of the
feminine invasion, and then he muttered to himself
<span class="tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span>
<a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rather than to the fat lady, "Nowhere&#39;s safe
from &#39;em; women and house-flies is universally prevailing."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The fat lady dropped his arm as if it had been
a brand. "He&#39;s no gentleman. As for Mountain
Pink, she was drove to it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">All that day they toiled over sand and sage-brush;
the sun hung like a molten disk, paling the
blue of the sky; the grasshoppers kept up their
shrill chirping—and the loneliness of that sun-scorched
waste became a tangible thing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Chugg sipped and sipped, and sometimes swore
and sometimes muttered, and as the day wore on
his driving not only became a challenge to the
endurance of the horses, but to the laws of gravitation.
He lashed them up and down grade, he drove
perilously close to shelving declivities, and sometimes
he sang, with maudlin mournfulness:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">"&#39;Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie.&#39;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">The words came low and mournfully</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">From the cold, pale lips of a youth who lay</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">On his dying couch at the close of day."</p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">The fat lady reminded him that he was a gentleman
and that he was driving ladies; she threatened
him with her son on Sweetwater, who began, in
the maternal chronicles, by being six feet in his
stockings, and who steadily grew, as the scale
of threats increased, till he reached the altitude of
six feet four, growing hourly in height and fierceness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But Chugg gave no heed, and once he sang the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span>
<a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
"Ballad of the Mule-Skinner," with what seemed
to both terrified passengers an awful warning of
their overthrow:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">"As I was going down the road,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">With a tired team and a heavy load,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">I cracked my whip and the leaders sprung—</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">The fifth chain broke, and the wheelers hung,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">The off-horse stepped on the wagon tongue—"</p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">This harrowing ballad was repeated with accompanying
Delsarte at intervals during the afternoon,
but as Mary and the fat lady managed to
escape without accident, they began to feel that
they bore charmed lives.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At sundown they came to the road-ranch of
Johnnie Dax, bearing Leander&#39;s compliments as a
secret despatch. The outward aspect of the place
was certainly an awful warning to trustful bachelors
who make acquaintances through the columns of
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">The Heart and Hand</span>. The house stood solitary in
that scourge of desolation. The windows and doors
gaped wide like the unclosed eyes of a dead man on
a battle-field. Chugg halloed, and an old white
horse put his head out of the door, shook it upward
as if in assent, then trotted off.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s Jerry, and he&#39;s the intelligentest animal
I ever see," remarked the stage-driver, sobering up
to Jerry&#39;s good qualities, and presently Johnnie
Dax and the white horse appeared together from
around the corner of the house.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This Mr. Dax was almost an exact replica of the
other, even to the apologetic crook in the knees
<span class="tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span>
<a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and a certain furtive way of glancing over the
shoulder as if anticipating missiles.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Pshaw now, ladies! why didn&#39;t you let me know
that you was coming? and I&#39;d have tidied up the
place and organized a few dried-apple pies."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Good house-keepers don&#39;t wait for company to
come before they get to their work," rebukefully
commented the fat lady.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mr. Dax, recognizing the voice of authority, seized
a towel and began to beat out flies, chickens, and
dogs, who left the premises with the ill grace of
old residents. Two hogs, dormant, guarded either
side of the door-step and refused so absolutely to
be disturbed by the flicking of the towel that
one was tempted to look twice to assure himself
that they were not the fruits of the sculptor&#39;s
chisel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Where&#39;s your wife?" sternly demanded the fat
lady.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, my Lord! I presume she&#39;s dancin&#39; a whole
lot over to Ervay. She packed her ball-gown in a
gripsack and lit out of here two days ago, p&#39;inting
that way. A locomotive couldn&#39;t stop her none
if she got a chance to go cycloning round a dance."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the mean time, the two hogs having failed to
grasp the fact that they were <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">de trop</span>, continued to
doze.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Come, girls, get up," coaxed Johnnie, persuasively.
"Maude, I don&#39;t know when I see you so lazy.
Run on, honey—run on with Ethel." For Ethel, the
piebald hog, finally did as she was bid.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary Carmichael could not resist the temptation
<span class="tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span>
<a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of asking how the hogs happened to have such
unusual names.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"To tell the truth, I done it to aggravate my wife.
When I finds myself a discard in the matrimonial
shuffle, I figgers on a new deal that&#39;s going to
inclood one or two anxieties for my lady partner—to
which end—viz., namely, I calls one hawg Ethel
and the other hawg Maude, allowing to my wife
that they&#39;re named after lady friends in the East.
Them lady friends might be the daughters of
Ananias and Sapphira, for all they ever happened,
but they answers the purpose of riling her same as
if they were eating their three squares daily. I have
hopes, everything else failing, that she may yet quit
dancing and settle down to the sanctity of the home
out of pure jealousy of them two proxy hawgs."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I can just tell you this," interrupted the fat
lady: "I don&#39;t enjoy occupying premises after
hawgs, no matter how fashionable you name &#39;em.
A hawg&#39;s a hawg, with manners according, if it&#39;s
named after the President of the United States or
the King of England."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s just what I used to think, marm, of all
critters before I enjoyed that degree of friendliness
that I&#39;m now proud to own. Take Jerry now, that
old white horse—why, me and him is just like brothers.
When I have to leave the kid to his lonesome
infant reflections and go off to chop wood, I just call
Jerry in, and he assoomes the responsibility of nurse
like he was going to draw wages for it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I reckon there&#39;s faults on both sides," said
the fat lady, impartially. "No natural woman
<span class="tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span>
<a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would leave her baby to a horse to mind while she
went off dancing. And no natural man would fill
his house full of critters, and them with highfalutin
names. Take my advice, turn &#39;em out."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary did not wait to hear the continuation of the
fat lady&#39;s advice. She went out on the desert to
have one last look at the west. The sun had taken
his plunge for the night, leaving his royal raiment of
crimson and gold strewn above the mountain-tops.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Her sunset reflections were presently interrupted
by the fat lady, who proposed that they should
walk till Mr. Dax had tidied up his house, observing,
with logic, that it did not devolve on them to
clean the place, since they were paying for supper
and lodging. They had gone but a little way when
sudden apprehension caused the fat lady to grasp
Mary&#39;s arm. Miss Carmichael turned, expecting
mountain-lions, rattlesnakes, or stage-robbers, but
none of these casualties had come to pass.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Land sakes! Here we be parading round the
prairie, and I never found out how that man cooked
his coffee."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What difference does it make, if we can drink
it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The ways of men cooks is a sealed book to you,
I reckon, or you wouldn&#39;t be so unconcerned—&#39;specially
in the matter of coffee. All men has got the
notion that coffee must be b&#39;iled in a bag, and if they
&#39;ain&#39;t got a regular bag real handy, they take what
they can get. Oh, I&#39;ve caught &#39;em," went on the
fat lady, darkly, "b&#39;iling coffee in improvisations
that&#39;d turn your stomach."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span>
<a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, yes," Mary hastily agreed, hoping against
hope that she wasn&#39;t going to be more explicit.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"And they are so cute about it, too; it&#39;s next to
impossible to catch &#39;em. You ask a man if he b&#39;iles
his coffee loose or tight, and he&#39;ll declare he b&#39;iles it
loose, knowing well how suspicious and prone to investigate
is the female mind. But you watch your
chance and take a look in the coffee-pot, and maybe
you&#39;ll find—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, yes, I&#39;ve heard—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;ve seen—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Let&#39;s hurry," implored Mary.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Have you made your coffee yet?" inquired the
fat lady.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, marm," promptly responded Johnnie.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I hope you b&#39;iled it in a bag—it clears it beautiful,
a bag does."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Johnnie shifted uneasily. "No, marm, I b&#39;iles it
loose. You see, bags ain&#39;t always handy."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The fat lady plied her eye as a weapon. No
Dax could stand up before an accusing feminine eye.
He quailed, made a grab for the coffee-pot, and
rushed with it out into the night.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What did I tell you?" she asked, with an air of
triumph.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Johnnie returned with the empty coffee-pot. "To
tell the truth, marm, I made a mistake. I &#39;ain&#39;t
made the coffee. I plumb forgot it. P&#39;raps you
could be prevailed on to assist this yere outfit to
coffee while I organizes a few sody-biscuits."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After supper, when the fat lady was so busy talking
"goo-goo" language to the baby as to be oblivious
<span class="tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span>
<a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of everything else, Mary Carmichael took the opportunity
to ask Johnnie if he knew anything about
Lost Trail. The name of her destination had come
to sound unpleasantly ominous in the ears of the
tired young traveller, and she feared that her inquiry
did not sound as casual as she tried to have
it. Nor was Johnnie&#39;s candid reply reassuring.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It&#39;s a pizen-mean country, from all I ever heard
tell. The citizens tharof consists mainly of coyotes
and mountain-lions, with a few rattlers thrown in
just to make things neighborly. This yere place"—waving
his hand towards the arid wastes which night
was making more desolate—"is a summer resort,
with modern improvements, compared to it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary screwed her courage to a still more desperate
point, and inquired if Mr. Dax knew a family named
Yellett living in Lost Trail.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Never heard of no family living there, excepting
the bluff at family life maintained by the wild beasts
before referred to. See here, miss, I ain&#39;t makin&#39; no
play to inquire into your affairs, but you ain&#39;t
thinkin&#39; o&#39; visitin&#39; Lost Trail, be you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Perhaps," said Mary, faintly; and then she, too,
talked "goo-goo" to the baby.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">The Rodneys At Home</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">All that long and never-to-be-forgotten night
the stage lurched through the darkness with
Mary Carmichael the solitary passenger. The fat
lady had warned Johnnie Dax that he was on no
account to replenish Chugg&#39;s flask, if he had the
wherewithal for replenishment on the premises.
Moreover, she threatened Dax with the fury of her
son should he fail in this particular; and Johnnie,
hurt to the quick by the unjust suspicion that he
could fail so signally in his duty to a lady, not
only refused to replenish the flask, but threatened
Chugg with a conditional vengeance in the event
of accident befalling the stage. It was with a
partially sobered and much-threatened stage-driver,
therefore, that Mary continued her journey
after the supper at Johnnie Dax&#39;s, but the
knowledge of it brought scant reassurance, and
it is doubtful if the red stage ever harbored any
one more wakeful than the pale, tired girl who
watched all the changes from dark to dawn at
the stage window.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Once or twice she caught a glimpse of distant
camp-fires burning and knew that some cattle outfit
<span class="tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span>
<a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was camped there for the night; and once they
drove so close that she could hear the cow-boys&#39;
voices, enriched and mellowed by distance, borne
to them on the cool, evening wind. It gave a sense
of security to know that these big-hearted, manly
lads were within call, and she watched the dwindling
spark of their camp-fires and strained her ears to
catch the last note of their singing, with something
of the feeling of severed comradeship. Range cattle,
startled from sleep by the stage, scrambled to their
feet and bolted headlong in the blind impulse of
panic, their horns and the confused massing of their
bodies showing in sharp silhouette against the
horizon for a moment, then all would settle into
quiet again. There was no moon that night, but
the stars were sown broadcast—softly yellow stars,
lighting the darkness with a shaded luster, like
lamps veiled in pale-yellow gauze. The chill
electric glitter of the stars, as we know it from
between the roofs of high houses, this world of
far-flung distance knows not. There the stars
are big and still, like the eyes of a contented
woman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The hoofs of the horses beat the night away as
regularly as the ticking of a clock. It grew darker
as the night wore on, and sometimes a coyote
would yelp from the fringe of willows that bordered
a creek in a way that made Mary recall tales of
banshees. And once, when the first pale streak of
dawn trembled in the east and the mountains looked
like jagged rocks heaved against the sky and in
danger of toppling, the whole dread picture brought
<span class="tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span>
<a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before her one of Vedder&#39;s pictures that hung in
the shabby old library at home.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They breakfasted somewhere, and Chugg put
fresh horses to the stage. She knew this from their
difference of color; the horses that they had left the
second Dax ranch with had been white, and these
that now toiled over the sand and desolation were
apparently brown. She could not be certain that
they were brown, or that they were toiling over the
sand and desolation, or that her name was Mary
Carmichael, or indeed of anything. Four days in
the train, and what seemed like four centuries in
the stage, eliminated any certainty as to anything.
She could only sit huddled into a heap and wait
for things to become adjusted by time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Chugg was behaving in a most exemplary manner.
He drove rigidly as an automaton, and apparently
he looked no longer on the "lightning" when it was
bottled. Once or twice he had applied his eye to
the pane that separated him from his passenger,
and asked questions relative to her comfort, but
Mary was too utterly dejected to reply in more than
monosyllables. As they crept along, the sun-dried
timbers of the stage creaked and groaned in seeming
protest at wearing its life away in endless journeyings
over this desert waste, then settled down into
one of those maddeningly monotonous reiterations
to which certain inanimate things are given in
seasons of nervous tension. This time it was:
"All the world&#39;s—a stage—creak—screech—all—the
world&#39;s a stage—creak—screech!" over and over
till Mary found herself fast succumbing to the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span>
<a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hypnotic effect of the constant repetition, listening
for it, even, with the tyrannous eagerness of overwrought
nerves, when the stage-driver broke the
spell with, "This here stage gets to naggin&#39; me along
about here. She&#39;s hungry for her axle-grease—that&#39;s
what ails her."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I suppose," Mary roused herself to say, "you
have quite a feeling of comradeship for the stage."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Me and Clara"—the stage had this name painted
on the side—"have been travelling together nigh
onto four year. And while there&#39;s times that I
would prefer a greater degree of reciprocity, these
yere silent companions has their advantages. Why,
compare Clara to them female blizzards—the two
Mrs. Daxes—and you see Clara&#39;s good p&#39;ints
immejit. Yes, miss, the thirst-quenchers are on
me if either one of the Dax boys wouldn&#39;t be glad
to swap, but I&#39;d have to be a heap more locoed than
I am now to consent to the transaction."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At sunset the interminable monotony of the
wilderness was broken by a house of curious architecture,
the like of which the tired young traveller
had never seen before, and whose singular candor
of design made her doubt the evidence of her own
thoroughly exhausted faculties. The house seemed
to consist of a series of rooms thrown, or rather
blown, together by some force of nature rather than
by formal design of builder or carpenter. The
original log-cabin of this composite dwelling looked
better built, more finished, neater of aspect than
those they had previously stopped at in crossing
the Desert. Springing from the main building, like
<span class="tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span>
<a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
claws from a crustacean, were a series of rooms
minus either side walls or flooring. Indeed, they
might easily have passed for porches of more
than usually commodious size had it not been for
the beds, bureaus, chairs, stove with attendant
pots, kettles, and supper in the course of preparation.
Seen from any vantage-point in the surrounding
country, the effect was that of an interior on the
stage—the background of some homely drama where
pioneer life was being realistically depicted. The
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">dramatis persona</span> who occupied the centre of the
stage when Mary Carmichael drove up was an
elderly woman in a rocking-chair. She was dressed
in a faded pink calico gown, limp and bedraggled,
whose color brought out the parchment-like hue
and texture of her skin in merciless contrast. Perhaps
because she still harbored illusions about the
perishable quality of her complexion, which gave
every evidence of having borne the brunt of merciless
desert suns, snows, blizzards, and the ubiquitous
alkali dust of all seasons, she wore a pink sun-bonnet,
though the hour was one past sundown,
and though she sat beneath her own roof-tree, even
if lacking the protection of four walls. From the
corner of her mouth protruded a snuff-brush, so constantly
in this accustomed place that it had come
to be regarded by members of her family as part
and parcel of her attire—the first thing assumed
in the morning, the last thing laid aside at night.
Mary Carmichael had little difficulty in recognizing
Judith Rodney&#39;s step-mother, <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">née</span> Tumlin—she who
had been the heroine of the romance lately recorded.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span>
<a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Rodney&#39;s interest in the girl alighting from
the stage was evinced in the palsied motion of the
chair as it quivered slightly back and forth in place
of the swinging seesaw with which she was wont to
wear the hours away. The snuff-brush was brought
into more fiercely active commission, but she said
nothing till Mary Carmichael was within a few inches
of her. Then, shifting the snuff-brush to a position
more favorable to enunciation, she said: "Howdy?
Ye be Miz Yellett&#39;s gov&#39;ment, ain&#39;t ye?" There was
something threatening in her aspect, as if the office
of governess to the Yelletts carried some challenging
quality.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Government?" repeated Mary, vaguely, her head
still rumbling with the noise and motion of the
stage; "I&#39;m afraid I hardly understand."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ain&#39;t you-uns goin&#39; to teach the Yellett outfit
ther spellin&#39;, writin&#39;, and about George Washington,
an&#39; how the Yankees kem along arter he was in his
grave an&#39; fit us and broke up the kentry so we had
ter leave our home in Tennessee an&#39; kem to this
yere outdacious place, where nobody knows the
diffunce between aig-bread an&#39; corn-dodger? I war
a Miss Tumlin from Tennessee."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The rocking-chair now began to recover its accustomed
momentum. This much-heralded educational
expert was far from terrifying. Indeed, to
Mrs. Rodney&#39;s hawklike gaze, that devoured every
visible item of Mary&#39;s extremely modest travelling-dress,
there was nothing so very wonderful about
"the gov&#39;ment from the East." With a deftness
compatible only with long practice, Mrs. Rodney
<span class="tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span>
<a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
now put a foot on the round of an adjoining chair
and shoved it towards Mary Carmichael in hospitable
pantomime, never once relaxing her continual
rocking the meantime. Mary took the chair, and
Mrs. Rodney, after freshening up the snuff-brush
from a small, tin box in her lap, put spurs to her
rocking-chair, so to speak, and started off at a brisk
canter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I &#39;low it&#39;s mighty queer you-uns don&#39;t recognize
the job you-uns kem out yere to take, when I call
it by name." From the sheltering flap of the pink
sun-bonnet she turned a pair of black eyes full of
ill-concealed suspicion. "Miz Yellett givin&#39; herself
as many airs &#39;bout hirin&#39; a gov&#39;ment &#39;s if she wuz
goin&#39; to Congress. Queer you don&#39;t know whether
you be one or not!" She withdrew into the sun-bonnet,
muttering to herself. She could not be
more than fifty, Mary thought, but her habit of
muttering and exhibiting her depopulated gums
while she was in the act of revivifying the snuff-brush
gave her a cronish aspect.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A babel of voices came from the open-faced room
on the opposite side of the house corresponding to
the one in which Mary and Mrs. Rodney were sitting.
Apparently supper was being prepared by some half-dozen
young people, each of whom thought he or she
was being imposed upon by the others. "Hand
me that knife." "Git it yourself." "I&#39;ll tell maw
how you air wolfing down the potatoes as fast as I
can fry &#39;em." "Go on, tattle-tale." This was the
repartee, mingled with the hiss of frying meat, the
grinding of coffee, the thumping sound made by
<span class="tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span>
<a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bread being hastily mixed in a wooden bowl standing
on a wooden table. The babel grew in volume.
Dogs added to it by yelping emotionally when the
smell of the newly fried meat tempted them too
near the platter and some one with a disengaged
foot at his disposal would kick them out of doors.
Personalities were exchanged more freely by members
of the family, and the meat hissed harder as it
was newly turned. "Laws-a-massy!" muttered Mrs.
Rodney; and then, shoving back the sun-bonnet, she
lifted her voice in a shrill, feminine shriek:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Eudory! Eu-dory! You-do-ry!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A Hebe-like creature, blond and pink-cheeked,
in a blue-checked apron besmeared with grease and
flour, came sulkily into her mother&#39;s presence. Seeing
Mary Carmichael, she grasped the skirt of the
greasy apron with the sleight of hand of a prestidigitateur
and pleated it into a single handful. Her
manner, too, was no slower of transformation. The
family sulks were instantly replaced by a company
bridle, aided and abetted by a company simper.
"I didn&#39;t know the stage was in yet, maw. I
been talking to Iry."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"This here be Miz Yellett&#39;s gov&#39;ment. Maybe
she&#39;d like to pearten up some before she eats."
She started the rocking-chair at a gallop, to signify
to her daughter that she washed her hands of further
responsibility. Being proficient in the sign language
of Mrs. Rodney&#39;s second self, as indeed was every
member of the family, Eudora led Mary to a bench
placed in one of the rooms enjoying the distinction
of a side wall, and indicated a family toilet service,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span>
<a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which displayed every indication of having lately
seen active service. A roll-towel, more frankly significant
of the multitude of the Rodneys than had
been the babel of voices, a discouraged fragment
of comb, a tin basin, a slippery atom of soap, these
Eudora proffered with an unction worthy of better
things. "I declare Mist&#39; Chugg have scarce left any
soap, an&#39; I don&#39;t believe thar&#39;s &#39;nother bit in the
house." Eudora&#39;s accent was but faintly reminiscent
of her mother&#39;s strong Smoky Mountain dialect,
as a crude feature is sometimes softened in the
second generation. It was not unpleasing on her
full, rosy mouth. The girl had the seductiveness of
her half-sister, Judith, without a hint of Judith&#39;s
spiritual quality.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary told her not to mind about the soap, and
went to fetch her hand-bag, which, consistent with
the democratic spirit of its surroundings, was resting
against a clump of sage-brush, whither it had
been lifted by Chugg. Miss Carmichael&#39;s individual
toilet service, which was neither handsome nor
elaborate, impressed Eudora far more potently in
ranking Mary as a personage than did her dignity
of office as "gov&#39;ment."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I reckon you-uns must have seen Sist&#39; Judy up
to Miz Dax&#39;s. I hope she war lookin&#39; right well."
There was in the inquiry an unmistakable note of
pride. The connection was plainly one to be flaunted.
Judith, with her gentle bearing and her simple,
convent accomplishments, was plainly the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">grande
dame</span> of the family. Eudora had now divested herself
of the greasy, flour-smeared apron, flinging it
<span class="tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span>
<a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
under the wash-bench with a single all-sufficient
movement, while Mary&#39;s look was directed towards
her dressing-bag. In glancing up to make some
remark about Judith, Mary was confronted by a
radiant apparition whose lilac calico skirts looked
fresh from the iron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At the side of the house languished a wretched,
abortive garden, running over with weeds and sage-brush,
and here a man pottered with the purposeless
energy of old age, working with an ear cocked in
the direction of the house, as he turned a spade of
earth again and again in hopeless, pusillanimous
industry. But when his strained attention was
presently rewarded by a shouted summons to supper,
and he stood erect but for the slouching droop of
shoulders that was more a matter of temperament
than of age, one saw a tall man of massive build,
whose keen glance and slightly grizzled hair belied
his groping, ineffectual labor. The head, and face
were finely modelled. Unless nature had fashioned
them in some vagrant, prankish mood, such
elegance of line betokened prior generations in
which gentlemen and scholars had played some part—the
vagabond scion of a good family, perhaps. A
multitude of such had grafted on the pioneer stock
of the West, under names that carried no significance
in the places whence they came.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Weakness and self-indulgence there were, and
those writ large and deep, on the face of Warren
Rodney; and, in default of an expression of deeper
significance, the wavering lines of instability produced
a curiously ambiguous effect of a fine head
<span class="tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span>
<a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
modelled by a &#39;prentice hand; a lady&#39;s copy of the
Belvidere, attempted in the ardors of the first lessons,
might approximate it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A smoking kerosene lamp revealed a supper-table
of almost institutional proportions. There
were four sons and two daughters of the Tumlin
union, strapping lads and lasses all of them, with
more than a common dower of lusty health and a
beauty that was something deeper than the perishable
iridescence of youth. There was Fremont,
named for the explorer-soldier; there was Orlando,
named from his mother&#39;s vague, idle musings over
paper-backed literature at certain "unchancy" seasons;
there was Richards, named from pure policy,
for a local great man of whom Warren Rodney had
anticipated a helping hand at the time; there was
Eudora, whose nominal origin was uncertain, unless
it bore affiliation to that of Orlando; there was
Sadie, thus termed to avoid the painful distinctions
of "old Sally" and "young Sally"; and, lastly,
like a postscript, came Dan—with him, fancy, in the
matter of names, seemed to have failed. Dan was
now six, a plump little caricature of a man in blue
overalls, which, as they had descended to him from
Richards in the nature of an heirloom, reached
high under his armpits and shortened the function
of his suspenders to the vanishing point.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Eudora was now sixteen, and the woman-famine
in all the land had gifted her with a surprising
precocity. Eudora knew her value and meant to
make the most of it. Unlike her mother in the old
Black Hill days, she expected more than a "home
<span class="tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span>
<a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of her own." To-night four suitors sat at table with
Eudora, and she might have had forty had she
desired it. Any one of the four would have cheerfully
murdered the remaining three had opportunity
presented itself. Supper was a mockery to them,
a Barmecide feast. Each watched his rivals—and
Eudora. This was a matter of life and death.
There was no time for food. The girl revelled in
the situation to the full of her untaught, unthinking,
primitive nature. She gave the incident a tighter
twist by languishing at them in turns. She smiled,
she sighed, she drove them mad by taking crescent
bites out of a slice of bread and exhibiting the havoc
of her little, white teeth with a delectably dainty
gluttony.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Her mother, mumbling her supper with toothless
impotency, renewed her youth vicariously, and,
while she quarrelled with her daughter from the
rising of the sun to the setting of the same, she
added the last straw to the burden of the distracted
suitors by announcing what a comfort Eudora was
to her and how handy she was about the house.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Warren Rodney supported the air of an exile at
his own table. Beyond a preliminary greeting to
his daughter&#39;s guests, he said nothing. His family,
in their dealings with him, seemed to accord him the
exemptions of extreme age. He ate with the enthusiasm
of a man to whom meals have become the
main business in life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How&#39;s your mine up to Bad Water comin&#39;
along, Iry?" Orlando inquired, not from any hospitable
interest in Ira&#39;s claim, but because he had
<span class="tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span>
<a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sundry romantic interests in that neighborhood and
hoped to make use of the young prospector&#39;s interest
in his sister by securing an invitation to return
with him. Ira regarded the inquiry in the light
of a special providence. Here was his chance to
impress Eudora with the splendor of his prospects
and at the same time smite the claims of his rivals,
and behold! a brother of his lady had led the way.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Ira cleared his throat. "They tell me she air
like to yield a million any day." At this Eudora
gave him the wealth of her eyes, and her mother
reached across two of the glowering suitors and
dropped a hot flapjack on his plate.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Who sez that she air likely to yield a million
any day?" inquired Ben Swift, openly flouting such
prophecy. "Yes, who sez it?" inquired Hawks and
Taylor, joining forces for the overthrow of the common
enemy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;They sez&#39; is easy talkin&#39;, shore &#39;nuff," mumbled
Mrs. Rodney, as she helped herself to butter with her
own knife.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"A sharp from the Smithsonian Institute at Washington,
he said it, and he has taken back speciments
with him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ye can&#39;t keep lackings from freightin&#39; round
speciments—naw, sir, ye can&#39;t, not till the fool-killer
has finished his job." Ben Swift charged the
table with the statement as the prosecution subtly
appeals to the high grade of intelligence on the
part of the jury. The point told. Eudora, wavering
in her donation of hot flapjacks, gave them to
Ben Swift.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span>
<a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Hawks now leaned across the table with a sinuous,
beguiling motion, and, extending his long neck towards
the prospector, with the air of a turkey-gobbler
about to peck, he crooned, softly: "Ira, it&#39;s a heap
risky puttin&#39; your faith in maverick sharps that
trail around the country, God-a&#39;mightying it, renaming
little, old rocks into precious stones, seein&#39;
gold mines in every gopher-hole they come to.
They names your backyard and the rocks appertainin&#39;
thereunto a heap fashionable, and like as
not some sucker gives him good money to float the
trash back East."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Rodney, whose partisanship in any discussion
was analogous to the position of a hen
perching on a fence unable to decide on which
side to flutter, was visibly impressed by Hawks&#39;s
presentation of the case. Looking towards her
daughter from under the eaves of her sun-bonnet,
she "&#39;lowed she had hearn that Bad Water was hard
on the skin, an&#39; that it warn&#39;t much of a place arter
all. Folks over thar war mostly half-livers."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Ira, now losing all semblance of policy at being
thus grievously put down by his possible mother-in-law,
"reckoned that herdin&#39; sheep over to the
Basin was a heap easier on the skin than livin&#39; in a
comf&#39;table house over to Bad Water"—this as a
fling at Hawks, who herded a small bunch of sheep
"over in the Basin."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ai-yi," openly scoffed the former Miss Tumlin;
"talk&#39;s cheap before—" She would have considered
it indelicate to supply the word "marriage,"
but by breaking off her sentence before she came
<span class="tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span>
<a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the pith of it she continued to maintain the proprieties,
and at the same time conveyed to her
audience that she was too old and experienced to
permit any fledgling from her nest to be caught, for
want of a warning, by such obvious ante-matrimonial
chaff as fair promises.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Laws a massy!" she continued, reminiscently,
working her toothless jaw to free it from an escaped
splinter from the snuff-brush. "When me an&#39; paw
war keepin&#39; comp&#39;ny, satin warn&#39;t good enough for
me. He lowed I wuz to have half creation. Sence
we wuz married he &#39;ain&#39;t never found time, endurin&#39;
all these years, to build me a bird-house."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The unbuilt bird-house was the Banquo&#39;s ghost
at the Rodney board, Mrs. Rodney hearkening back
to it in and out of season. If the family made
merry over a chance windfall of game or fresh
vegetables, a prospect of possible employment for
one of the boys, a donation of money from Judith,
Mrs. Rodney remembered the unbuilt bird-house
and indulged herself to the full of melancholy. It is
not improbable that, if she had been asked to name
the chiefest disappointment of her wretched married
life, she would have mentioned the bird-house that
was never built.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At mention of it Warren Rodney murmured broken,
deprecatory excuses. His dull eyes nervously
travelled about the table for some one to make
excuses for him. The family broke into hearty peals
of laughter; the tragedy of the first generation had
grown to be the unfailing source of merriment for
the second.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span>
<a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Maw," began Orlando, "the reason you don&#39;t
get no bird-house built out hyear is that they ain&#39;t
no birds. We have offered time and time again to
build you a house fo&#39; buzzuds, they bein&#39; the only
birds hyearabouts, but you &#39;low that you ain&#39;t
fav&#39;ble to tamin&#39; &#39;em."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I wuz raised in Tennessee, an&#39; we-uns had a house
for martins made out&#39;n gourds, an&#39; it was pearty."
The pride with which she repeated this particular
claim to honor in an alien land never diminished with
repetition. As she advanced further through the
dim perspective of years, the little mountain town
in Tennessee became more and more the centre of
cultivation and civic importance. The desolate
cabin that she had left for the interminable journey
westward was recalled flatteringly through the
hallowing mists of time. The children, by reason
of these chronicles, had grown to regard their
mother as a sort of princess in exile.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Mrs. Rodney"—Swift leaned towards her and
whispered something in her ear. She regarded him
tentatively, then grinned. At her time of life, why
should she put faith in the promises of men? "You
fix it up, an&#39; you get your bird-house," was the
conclusion of his sentence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">While this discussion had been in progress the
viands had not been neglected except by such members
of the company as had been bereft of appetite
by loftier emotions—in consequence of which the
table appeared to have sustained a visitation of
seventeen-year locusts. Eudora, ever economic in
the value she placed not only upon herself but her
<span class="tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span>
<a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
environment, proposed to her guests that they should
wash the dishes, an art in which they were by no
means deficient, being no exception to the majority
of range bachelors in their skill in homely pursuits.
And thus it came to pass that Eudora&#39;s suitors,
swathed in aprons, meekly washed dishes shoulder
to shoulder, while their souls craved the performance
of valorous deeds.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As this was the last stage station on the way to
Lost Trail, Mary Carmichael was perforce obliged
to content herself till Mrs. Yellett should call or
send for her. After supper, Chugg, with fresh
horses to the stage, left Rodney&#39;s, apparently for
some port in that seemingly pathless sea of foot-hills.
That there should be trails and defined routes
over this vast, unvaried stretch of space seemed more
wonderful to Mary than the charted high-roads of
the Atlantic. The foot-hills seemed to have grown
during the long journey till they were foot-hills no
longer; they had come to be the smaller peaks of
the towering range that had formed the spine of the
desert. The air, that seemed to have lost some of
its crystalline quality on the flat stretches of the
plains, was again sparkling and heady in the clean
hill country. It stirred the pulses like some rare
vintage, some subtle distillation of sun-warmed
fruit that had been mellowing for centuries.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Very lonely seemed the Rodney home among the
great company of mountains. A brooding desolation
had settled on it at close of day, and all the
laughter and light footsteps and gayly ringing
voices of the young folk could not dispel the feeling
<span class="tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span>
<a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of being adrift in a tiny shell on the black waters
of some unknown sea; or thus it seemed to the
stranger within their gate.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Rodney retired within the flap of her sun-bonnet
after the evening meal, settling herself in
the rocking-chair as if it were some sort of conveyance.
Her family, who might have told the
hour of day or her passing mood by the action of
the chair, knew by her pacific gait that she would
lament the unbuilt bird-house no more that night.
The snuff-brush, newly replenished from the tin
box, kept perfect time to the motion of the chair.
With the lady of the house it was one of the brief
seasons of passing content vouchsafed by an ample
meal and a good digestion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Warren Rodney took down a gun from the wall
and began to clean it. His hands had the fumbling,
indefinite movements, the obscure action, directed
by a brain already begun to crumble. His industry
with the gun was of a part with the impotent
dawdling in the garden. His eyes would seek for
the rag or the bottle of oil in a dull, glazed way, and,
having found them, he would forget the reason of
his quest. Not once that evening had they rested
on his wife or any member of his family. He had
shown no interest in any of the small happenings
of home, the frank rivalry of Eudora&#39;s suitors, the
bickerings of the girls and boys over the division
of household labor. The one thing that had momentarily
aroused his somnolent intelligence was a
revival of his wife&#39;s plaint anent the unbuilt bird-house.
That, and a certain furtive anxiety during
<span class="tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span>
<a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
supper lest his daughter Eudora should forget to
keep his plate piled high, were the only signs of a
participation in the life about him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">From one of the rooms that opened to the world
like a stage to the audience, Mrs. Rodney kept her
evening vigil. The last faint amethystine haze on
the mountains was deepening. They towered about
the valley where the house lay, with a challenging
immensity, mocking the pitiful grasp of these
pygmies on the thousand hills. The snow on the
taller of the peaks still held the high lights. But
all the valleys and the spaces between the mountains
were wrapped in sombre shadows; the crazy house
invading the great company of mountains, penetrating
brazenly to the very threshold of their
silent councils, seemed but a pitiful ant-hill at the
mercy of some possible giant tread. The ill-adjusted
family, disputing every inch of ground with
the wilderness, became invested with a dignity
quite out of keeping with its achievements. Their
very weaknesses and vanities, old Sally still clinging
to her sun-bonnet and her limp rose-colored skirts,
an eternal requiem for the dead and gone complexion,
lost the picturesqueness of the pioneer and
ranked as universal qualities, admissible in the
austerest setting. Perhaps in some far distant council
of the Daughters of the Pioneers a prospective
member of the house of Rodney would unctuously
announce: "My great-great-grandmother was a
Miss Tumlin of Tennessee; great-great-grandfather&#39;s
first wife had been a Sioux squaw. Isn&#39;t it interesting
and romantic?"</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span>
<a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Eudora now came to her mother with great news.
Hawks had taken the first opportunity of being
alone with her to tell her of Jim&#39;s release from jail
and of his abortive encounter with Simpson in the
eating-house. He had not deferred the telling from
any feeling of reticence regarding the disclosure of
family affairs before strangers. News travels in
the desert by some unknown agency. Twenty-four
hours after a thing happened it would be safe
to assume that every cow and sheep outfit in a
radius of three hundred miles would be discussing
it over their camp-fires; and this long before there
was an inch of telegraph wire or a railroad tire in
the country. Hawks had merely reserved the news
for Eudora&#39;s private ear because he hoped thus to
gain an advantage over his three rivals.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ai-yi!" said old Sally, sharply, and the chair
came to an abrupt stand-still. "In the name o&#39;
Heaven, how kem they to let him out?" Mrs.
Rodney&#39;s knowledge of the law was of the vaguest;
and if incarceration would keep a prisoner out of
more grievous trouble, she could not understand
giving him his freedom. To her the case was
analogous to releasing a child from the duress of a
corner and turning him loose to play with matches.
"How kem they to let him out?" she repeated,
the still rocking-chair conveying the impersonal
dignity of the pulpit or the justice-seat. "I &#39;ain&#39;t
hearn tell of so pearty a couple as the jail an&#39; Jim
in years."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The meaning that she put into her words belied
their harsh face-value. With Jim in jail, her mind
<span class="tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span>
<a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was comparatively at rest about him. She knew
he had been branding other men&#39;s cattle since the
destruction of his sheep, and she knew the fate of
cattle-thieves, and that Jim would be no exception
to the rule. With her purely instinctive maternity,
she had been fond of Jim. He had been one more
boy to mother. She harbored no ill-feeling towards
him that he was not her own. Moreover, she
wanted no gallows-tree intermingled with the annals
of her family. It suited her convenience at this
particular time that Jim should stay in jail. That
he had been given his freedom loosed the phials of
her condemnation on the incompetents that released
him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I &#39;low they wuz grudgin&#39; him the mouthful they
fed to him, that they ack so outdaciously plumb
locoed as to tu&#39;n a man out to get hisself hanged.
An&#39; Jim never wuz a hearty eater. He never seemed
to relish his food, even when he wuz a growin&#39; kid."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A pale, twinkling point of light, faintly glimmering
in the vast solitudes above the billowing peaks,
suddenly burst into a dazzling constellation before
the girl and her mother. "It&#39;s a warning!" shivered
the old woman. "Some&#39;um&#39;s bound to happen."
She began to rock herself slowly. The thing she
dreaded had already come to pass in her imagination.
Jim a free man was Jim a dead man. He was so
dead that already his step-mother was going on with
a full acceptance of the idea. She reviewed her
relationship to him. No, she had nothing to blame
herself for. He had been more troublesome than
any of her own children and for that reason she had
<span class="tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span>
<a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been more liberal with the rod. And yet—the face
of the squaw rose before her, wraithlike, accusing!
"Ai-yi!" she said; but this time her favorite expletive
was hardly more than a sigh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I mind Jim when he first kem to us," she said,
more to herself than to Eudora, who sat at her feet.
The impending tragedy in the family had robbed
her of all the joy in her suitors. They sat on a
bench on the opposite side of the house, divided
by the very nature of their interests yet companions
in misery.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He wuz scarce four, an&#39; yet he had never been
broke of the habit of sucking his thumb. Ef he&#39;d
ben my child, I&#39;d a lammed it out&#39;n him before he&#39;d
a seen two, but seem&#39; he was aged for an infant
havin&#39; such practices, I tried to shame him out&#39;n it.
But, Lord a massy, men folks is hard to shame even
at four. I hissed at him like a gyander every time
I seen him do it. Now I&#39;d a knowed better—I&#39;d
a sewed it up in a pepper rag."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What&#39;s suckin&#39; his thumb as an infant got to do
with his gettin&#39; lynched now?" demanded Eudora,
with the scepticism of the second generation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Wait till you-uns has children of your own,"
sniffed her mother, from the assured position of
maternal experience, "an&#39; see the infant that&#39;s
allowed to suck its thumb has the makin&#39;s in him
of a felon or a unfortunit." She rocked a slow accompaniment
to her dismal, prophecy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Eudora&#39;s eyes, big with wonder, were fixed on the
crouching flank of a distant mountain. Her mother
broke the silence. Not often did they speak thus
<span class="tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span>
<a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
intimately. Old Sally belonged to that class of
mothers who feel a pride in their reticent dealings
with their daughters, and who consider the management
of all affairs of the heart peculiarly the
province of youth and inexperience.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But to-night she was prompted by a force beyond
her ken to speak to the girl. "Eudory, in pickin&#39;
out one of them men," she jerked her thumb towards
the opposite side of the house, "git one tha&#39;s clar
o&#39; the trick o&#39; stampedin&#39; round other wimming.
It&#39;s bound to kem back to ye, same as counterfeit
money."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Eudora giggled. She was of an age when the
fascinations of curiosity as to the unknown male
animal prompt lavish conjecture. "I &#39;lowed they
all stampeded."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes," leered the old woman—and she grinned
the whole horrid length of her empty gums—"the
most of &#39;em does. But you must shet your eyes
to it. The moment they know you swallow it,
they&#39;s wuthless, like horses that has run away
once."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Hark!" said Eudora. "Ain&#39;t that wheels?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It be," answered her mother. "It be that old
Ma&#39;am Yellett after her gov&#39;ment."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span>

<hr class="page" />

<div class="tei tei-div">
<h1 class="tei tei-head">IX</h1>
<a name="toc_10" id="toc_10"></a>
<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">Mrs. Yellett And Her "Gov&#39;ment"</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The buckboard drew up to the back or open-faced
entrance of the Rodney house with a
splendid sweep, terminating in a brilliantly staccato
halt, as if to convey to the residents the flattering
implication that their house was reached via a
gravelled driveway, rather than across lumpish inequalities
of prairie overgrown with cactus stumps
and clumps of sage-brush. From the buckboard
stepped a figure whose agility was compatible with
her driving.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">No sketchy outline can do justice to Mrs. Yellett
or her costume. Like the bee, the ant, and other
wonders of the economy of nature, she was not to
be disposed of with a glance. And yet there was
no attempt at subtlety on her part; on the contrary,
no one could have an appearance of greater candor
than the lady whose children Mary Carmichael had
come West to teach. Her costume was a thing apart,
suggesting neither sex, epoch, nor personal vanity,
but what it lacked of these more usual sartorial
characteristics, it more than made up in a passionate
individualism; an excessively short skirt, so innocent
of "fit" or "hang" in its wavering, indeterminate
<span class="tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span>
<a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
outline as to suggest the possible workmanship
of teeth rather than of scissors; and riding-boots
coming well to the knee, displaying a well-shaped,
ample foot, perched aloft on the usual high heel
that cow-punchers affect as the expression of their
chiefest vanity. But Mrs. Yellett was not wholly
mannish in her tastes, and to offset the boots she
wore a bodice of the type that a generation ago used
to be known as a "basque." It fitted her ample
form as a cover fits a pin-cushion, the row of jet
buttons down the front looking as if a deep breath
might cause them to shoot into space at any moment
with the force of Mauser bullets.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Such a garb was not, after all, incongruous with
this original lady&#39;s weather-beaten face. Her skin
was tanned to a fine russet, showing tiny, radiating
lines about the eyes when they twinkled with
laughter, which was often. No individual feature
was especially striking, but the general impression
of her countenance was of animation and activity,
mingled with geniality and with native shrewdness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Howdy, Miz Yellett," called out old Sally,
hitching her rocker forward, in an excitement she
could ill conceal. "You-uns&#39; gov&#39;ment come, an&#39;
she ain&#39;t much bigger&#39;n a lettle green gourd. Don&#39;t
seem to have drawed all the growth comin&#39; to her
yit."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"In roundin&#39; up the p&#39;ints of my gov&#39;ment, Mis&#39;
Rodney, you don&#39;t want to forget that green gourds
and green grapes is mighty apt to belong to the
sour fambly, when they hangs beyant your reach."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span>
<a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ai-yi!" grimaced old Sally. "It&#39;s tol&#39;able far
to send East for green fruit. We can take our own
pep&#39;mint."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The prospective advent of a governess in the
Yellett family, moreover, one from that mysterious
centre of culture, the East, had not only rent the
neighborhood with bitter factions, but had submitted
the Yelletts to the reproach of ostentation.
In those days there were no schools in that portion
of the Wind River country where the Yelletts
grazed their flocks and herds. Parents anxious to
obtain "educational advantages"—that was the
term, irrespective of the age of the student or the
school he attended—sent them, often, with parental
blindness as to the equivocal nature of the blessing
thus conferred, to visit friends in the neighboring
towns while they "got their education." Or they
went uneducated, or they picked up such crumbs
of knowledge as fell from the scant parental board.
But never, up to the present moment, had any one
flown into the face of neighborly precedent except
sturdy Sarah Yellett.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Old Sally, in her eagerness to convey that she was
in no degree impressed with the pedagogical importation,
like many another belligerent lost the
first round of the battle through an excess of
personal feeling. But though down, Sally was by
no means out, and after a brief session with the
snuff-brush she returned to the field prepared to
maintain that the Yellett children, for all their
pampering in the matter of having a governess
imported for their benefit, were no better off than
<span class="tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span>
<a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
her own brood, who had taken the learning the gods
provided.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Too bad, Miz Yellett, that you-uns had to hire
that gov&#39;ment without lookin&#39; over her p&#39;ints. I&#39;ve
ben takin&#39; her in durin&#39; supper, and she&#39;ll never be
able to thrash &#39;em past Clem. She mought be able
to thrash Clem if she got plumb mad, these yere
slim wimmin is tarrible wiry &#39;n&#39; active at such times,
but she&#39;ll never be able to thrash beyant her."
And having injected the vitriolic drop in her neighbor&#39;s
cup of happiness, Old Sally struck a gait on
her chair which was the equivalent of a gallop.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But Mrs. Yellett was not the sort of antagonist to
be left gaping on the road, awed to silence by the
action of a rocking-chair, no matter how brilliant.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I reckon I can thrash my own children when it&#39;s
needed, without gettin&#39; in help from the East, or
hereabouts either, for that matter. If other folks
would only take out their public-spirited reformin&#39;
tendencies on their own famblies, there&#39;d be a heap
less lynchin&#39; likely to happen round the country in
the course of the next ten years."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Old Sally let the home-thrust pass. "Who ever
hearn tell of a good teacher that wasn&#39;t a fine
thrasher in the bargain?" She swung the chair
about with a pivotal motion, as if she were addressing
an assemblage instead of a single listener, and
then, bethinking herself of a clinching illustration,
she called aloud to her daughter to bear witness.
"Eudory! Eu-do-ry! You-do-ry!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ye-&#39;s ma&#39;am," drawled the daughter, coming
most unwillingly from the open-faced room opposite,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span>
<a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
where she had been inciting all four of the suitors to
battle.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What was it they called that teacher down to
Caspar that larruped the hide off&#39;n the boys?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"A fine dis-a-<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">ply</span>-narian, maw."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, that&#39;s it—a dis-a-<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">ply</span>-narian. What kin a
lettle green gourd like her know &#39;bout dis-apply-in?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Your remarks shore remind me of a sayin&#39; that
&#39;the discomfort of havin&#39; to swallow other folks&#39; dust
causes a heap of anxiety over their reckless driving.&#39;"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Yellett flicked her riding-boot with her whip.
Her voice dropped a couple of tones, her accent
became one of honeyed sweetness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Your consumin&#39; anxiety regardin&#39; my gov&#39;ment
and my children shore reminds me of a narrative
appertainin&#39; to two dawgs. Them dawgs was neighbors,
livin&#39; in adj&#39;inin&#39; yards separated by a fence,
and one day one of them got a good meaty bone and
settled hisself down to the enj&#39;yment thereof. And
his intimate friend and neighbor on the other side
of the fence, who had no bone to engage his faculties,
he began to fret hisself &#39;bout the business of his
friend. S&#39;pose he was to choke hisself over that
bone. S&#39;pose the meat disagreed with him. And
he begins to bark warnin&#39;s, but the dawg with
the bone he keeps right on. But the other dawg
he dashes hisself again the fence and he scratches
with his claws. He whines pitiful, he&#39;s that anxious
about his friend. But the dawg with the bone he
went right on till he gnawed it down to the last
morsel, and, goin&#39; to the hole in the fence whar his
<span class="tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span>
<a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
friend had kep&#39; that anxious vigil, he says: &#39;Friend,
the only thing that consoled me while having to
endure the anguish of eatin&#39; that bone was the
thought of your watchful sympathy!&#39; Which bein&#39;
the case, I&#39;d thank you to tell me whar I can find
my gov&#39;ment."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ai-yi!" said old Sally. "I ain&#39;t seein&#39; no bone
this deal. Just a lettle green gourd &#39;s all I see with
my strongest specs."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary Carmichael, in one of the inner rooms, was
writing a home letter, which was chiefly remarkable
for what it failed to relate. It gave long accounts
of the scenery, it waxed didactic over the future of
the country; but the adventures of the trip, with her
incidental acquaintance with the Daxes and Chugg,
were not recorded. Eudora announced the arrival
of Mrs. Yellett, and Mary, at the news, dropped the
contents of her portfolio and started up with much
the feeling a marooned sailor might have on hearing
a sail has been sighted. At this particular stage of
her career Miss Carmichael had not developed the
philosophy that later in life was destined to become
her most valuable asset. Her sense of humor no
longer responded to the vagaries of pioneer life. The
comedy element was coming a little too thick and
fast. She was getting a bit heart-sick for a glimpse
of her own kind, a word with some one who spoke
her language. And here, at last, was the woman
who had written such a charming letter, who had
so graciously intimated that there was room for her
at the hearth-stone. Mary was, indeed, eager to
make the acquaintance of Mrs. Yellett.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span>
<a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">To the end of her life she never forgot that first
meeting—the perfect confidence with which she
followed Eudora to the open room, the ensuing blank
amazement, the utter inability to reconcile the Mrs.
Yellett of the letter with the Mrs. Yellett of fact.
The lamp on the table, burning feebly, seemed to
burst into a thousand shooting-stars as the girl
struggled with her tears. Home was so far, and
Mrs. Yellett was so different from what she had
expected! And yet, as she felt her fingers crush
in the grip of that hard but not unkindly hand,
there was in the woman&#39;s rugged personality a
sustaining quality; and, thinking again of Archie&#39;s
prospects, Mary was not altogether sorry that she
had come.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You be a right smart young maverick not to get
lost none on this long trail, and no one to p&#39;int you
right if you strayed," commented Mary&#39;s patroness,
affably. "But we won&#39;t roominate here no longer
than we can help. It&#39;s too hard on old Ma&#39;am
Rodney. She&#39;s just &#39;bout the color of withered
cabbage now, &#39;long of me havin&#39; you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">While she talked, Mrs. Yellett picked up Mary&#39;s
trunk and bags and stowed them in the back of the
buckboard with the ease with which another woman
might handle pasteboard boxes. One or two
of the male Rodneys offered to help, but she waved
them aside and lashed the luggage to the buckboard,
handling the ropes with the skill of an old
sailor. The entire Rodney family and the suitors
of Eudora assembled to witness the departure. "It&#39;s
a heap friendly of you to fret so," was the parting
<span class="tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span>
<a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stab of Sarah Yellett to Sally Rodney; and she swung
the backboard about, cleared the cactus stumps in the
Rodney door-yard, and gained the mountain-road.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ai-yi!" said old Sally. "What&#39;s this country
comin&#39; to?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"A few more women, thank God!" remarked Ira.
Eudora had just snubbed him, and he put a wealth
of meaning into his look after the vanishing buckboard.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The night was magnificent. From horizon to
horizon the sky was sown with quivering points of
light. Each straggling clump of sage-brush, rocky
ledge, and bowlder borrowed a beauty not its own
from the yellow radiance of the stars.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They had gone a good two miles before Mary&#39;s
patroness broke the silence with, "Nothing plumb
stampedes my temper like that Rodney outfit—old
Sally buckin&#39; an&#39; pitchin&#39; in her rockin&#39;-chair same
as if she was breakin&#39; a bronco, an&#39; that Eudory
always corallin&#39;, deceivin&#39;, and jiltin&#39; one outfit of
men after another. If she was a daughter of mine,
I&#39;d medjure her length across my knee, full growed
and courted though she is. The only one of the outfit
that&#39;s wuth while is Judith, an&#39; she ain&#39;t old
woman Rodney&#39;s girl, neither. You hyeard that
already, did you? Well, this yere country may be
lackin&#39; in population, but it&#39;s handy as a sewin&#39;-circle
in distributin&#39; news."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary mentioned Leander. "Yes," answered Mrs.
Yellett, reflectively, "Leander&#39;s mouth do run about
eight and a half octaves. Sometimes I don&#39;t blame
his wife for bangin&#39; down the lid."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span>
<a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">They talked of Jim Rodney&#39;s troubles, and the
growing hatred between sheep and cattle men,
because of range rights.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Now that pore Jim had a heap of good citizen
in him, before that pestiferous cattle outfit druv&#39;
his sheep over the cliff. Relations &#39;twixt sheep and
cattle men in this yere country is strained beyant
the goin&#39;-back place, I can tell you. My pistol-eye
&#39;ain&#39;t had a wink of sleep for nigh on eighteen months,
an&#39; is broke to wakefulness same as a teethin&#39; babe.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Jim was wild as a coyote &#39;fore he marries that
girl. She come all the way from Topeka, Kansas,
thinking she was goin&#39; to find a respectable home,
and when she come out hyear and found the place
was a dance-hall, she cried all the time. She didn&#39;t
add none to the hilarity of the place. An&#39; one day
Jim he strolled in, an&#39; seem&#39; the girl a-cryin&#39; like
a freshet and wishin&#39; she was dead, he inquired the
cause. She told him how that old harpy wrote her,
an&#39;, bein&#39; an orphant, she come out thinkin&#39; she was
goin&#39; to a respectable place as waitress, an&#39; Jim he
&#39;lowed it was a case for the law. He was a little shy
of twenty at the time, just a young cockerel &#39;bout
br&#39;ilin&#39; size. Some of the old hangers-on &#39;bout the
place they see a heap of fun in Jim&#39;s takin&#39; on &#39;bout
the girl, he bein&#39; that young that he had scarce
growed a pair of spurs yet. An&#39; one of &#39;em says to
him,&#39; Sonny, if you&#39;re afeerd that this yere corral is
onjurious to the young lady&#39;s morals, we&#39;ll call in
the gospel sharp, if you&#39;ll stand for the brand.&#39; Now
Jim hadn&#39;t a cent, nor no callin&#39;, nor a prospect to
his back, but he struts up to the man that was doin&#39;
<span class="tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span>
<a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the talkin&#39;, game as a bantam, an&#39; he says, &#39;The
lady ain&#39;t rakin&#39; in anythin&#39; but a lettle white chip,
in takin&#39; me, but if she&#39;s willin&#39;, here&#39;s my hand.&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"At which that pore young thing cried harder
than ever. Well, Jim he up an&#39; marries the girl
an&#39; it turns out fine. He gets a job herdin&#39; sheep on
shares, an&#39; she stays with the Rodney outfit till he
saves enough to build a cabin. Things is goin&#39; with
Jim like a prairie afire. In a few years he acquires
a herd of his own, a fine herd, not a scabby sheep
in the bunch. Alida she makes him the best kind
of a wife, them kids is the pride of his life, and then,
them cursed cattle-men do for him. Of course, he
takes to rustlin&#39;; I&#39;d do more&#39;n rustle if they&#39;d touch
mine."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The pair of broncos that Mrs. Yellett was driving
humped their backs like cats as they climbed the
steep mountain-road. With her, driving was an
exact science. It was a treat to see her handle the
ribbons. Mary asked some trifling question about
the children and it elicited the information that
one of the girls was named Cacta. "Yes," she said,
"I like new names for children, not old ones that is
all frazzled out and folks has suffered an&#39; died to.
It seems to start &#39;em fair, like playin&#39; cards with a
new deck. Cacta&#39;s my oldest daughter, and I named
her after the flowers that blooms all over the desert
spite of everything, heat, cold, an&#39; rain an&#39; alkali
dust—the cactus blooms right through it all. Even
its own thorns don&#39;t seem to fret it none. I called
her plain Cactus till she was three, and along came
a sharp studyin&#39; the flowers an&#39; weeds out here, and
<span class="tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span>
<a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he &#39;lowed that Cactus was a boy&#39;s name an&#39; Cacta
was for girls—called it a <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">fee</span>minin tarnation, or
somethin&#39; like that, so we changed it. My second
daughter &#39;ain&#39;t got quite so much of a name. She&#39;s
called Clematis. That holds its own out here pretty
well, &#39;long by the willows on the creek. Paw &#39;lowed
he was terrible afraid that I&#39;d name the youngest
girl Sage-brush, so he spoke to call her Lessie Viola,
an&#39; I giv&#39; in. The boys is all plain named, Ben,
Jack, and Ned. Paw wouldn&#39;t hear of a fancy brand
bein&#39; run onto &#39;em."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The temperature fell perceptibly as they climbed
the heights, and the air had the heady quality of
wine. It was awesome, this entering into the great
company of the mountains. Presently Mary caught
the glimmer of something white against the dark
background of the hills. It gleamed like a snow-bank,
though they were far below the snow-line on
the mountain-side they were climbing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, here be camp," announced Mrs. Yellett.
What Mary had taken for a bank of snow was a
huge, canvas-covered wagon. Several dogs ran
down to greet the buckboard, barking a welcome.
In the background was a shadowy group, huge of
stature, making its way down the mountain-path.
"And here&#39;s all the children come to meet teacher."
Mrs. Yellett&#39;s tone was tenderly maternal, as if it
was something of a feat for the children to walk down
the mountain-path to meet their teacher. But
Mary, straining her eyes to catch a glimpse of her
little pupils, could discover nothing but a group of
persons that seemed to be the sole survivors of some
<span class="tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span>
<a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
titanic race. Not one among them but seemed to
have reached the high-water mark of six feet. Was
it an optical illusion, a hallucination born of the
wonderful starlight? Or were they as huge as they
seemed? The young men looked giants, the girls
as if they had wandered out of the first chapters of
Genesis. Their mother introduced them. They all
had huge, warm, perspiring hands, with grips like
bears. Mary looked about for a house into which
she could escape to gather her scattered faculties,
but the starlight, yellow and luminous, revealed
none. There was the huge covered wagon that she
had taken for a snow-bank, there was a small tent,
there were two light wagons, there were dogs innumerable,
but there was no sign of a house.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What do you think of it?" inquired Mrs. Yellett,
smilingly, anticipating a favorable answer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It&#39;s almost too beautiful to leave." Mary innocently
supposed that Mrs. Yellett referred to the
starlit landscape. "But I&#39;m so tired, Mrs. Yellett,
and so glad to get to a real home at last, that I&#39;m
going to ask if you will not show me the way to
the house so that I may go to bed right away."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This apparently reasonable request was greeted
by a fine chorus of titanic laughter from Mary&#39;s
pupils. Mrs. Yellett waved her hand over the surrounding
landscape in comprehensive gesture.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ain&#39;t all this large enough for you?" she asked,
gayly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You mean the mountains? They&#39;re wonderful.
But—I really think I&#39;d like to go in the house."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I shore hope you ain&#39;t figgerin&#39; on goin&#39; into no
<span class="tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span>
<a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
house, &#39;cause there ain&#39;t no house to go into." She
laughed merrily, as if the idea of such an effete
luxury as a house were amusing. "This yere family
&#39;ain&#39;t ever had a house—it camps."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary gasped. The real meaning of words no
longer had the power of making an impression on
her. If Mrs. Yellett had announced that they were
in the habit of sleeping in the moon, it would not
have surprised her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"If you are tired, an&#39; want to go to bed, you can
shuck off and lie down any time. Ben, Jack, Ned,
go an&#39; set with paw in the tent while the gov&#39;ment
gets ready for bed. Cacta and Clem, you help me
with them quilts."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary stood helpless in the wilderness while quilts
and pillows were fetched somewhere from the adjacent
scenery, and Mrs. Yellett asked her, with the
gravity of a Pullman porter interrogating a passenger
as to the location of head and foot, if she liked
to sleep "light or dark." She chose "dark" at
random, hating to display her ignorance of the
alternatives, with the happy result that her bed
was made up to leeward of the great sheep-wagon,
in a nice little corner of the State of Wyoming.
Mary was grateful that she had chosen dark.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As she dozed off, she was reminded of a certain
magazine illustration that Archie had pinned over
his bed after the aunts had given a grudging consent
to this westward journey. There was a line beneath
the pictorial decoy which read: "Ranch Life
in the New West." And there were piazzas with
fringed Mexican hammocks, wild-grass cushions,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span>
<a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a tea-table with a samovar, and, last, a lady in
white muslin pouring tea. The stern reality apparently
consisted in scorching alkali plains, with
houses of the packing-box school of architecture
at a distance of seventy or eighty miles apart. No
ladies in white muslin poured tea; they garbed
themselves in simple gunny-sacking, and their repartee
had an acrid, personal note. But Mary was
glad to know that Archie had that picture, and that
he thought of her in such ideal surroundings.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">On Horse-thief Trail</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith, on her black mare, Dolly, left the
Dax ranch after the mid-day meal to go in
quest of her brother. He had left his comfortable
cabin on the Bear Creek, when he had turned rustler,
and moved into the "bad man&#39;s country," one of
those remote mountain fastnesses that abound in
Wyoming and furnish a natural protection to the
fugitive from justice. Judith took the left fork
of the road even as Peter Hamilton had chosen the
right, the day she had watched him gallop towards
Kitty Colebrooke with never a glance backward.
Judith strove now to put him and the memory of
that day from her mind by turning towards the
open country without a glance in the direction he
had taken. But her thoughts were weary of journeying
over that trail that she would not look towards;
in imagination she had travelled it with Peter a
hundred times, saw each dip and turn of the yellow
road, each feature of the landscape as he rode
exultant to Kitty, to be turned, tried, taken or left
as her mood should prompt. But Judith was more
woman than saint, and in her heart there was a
blending of joy and pain. For she knew—such
<span class="tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span>
<a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
skill has love in inference from detail—that the
mysterious far-away girl, who was so powerful that
she could have whatever she wanted, even to Peter,
loved her own ambitions better than she did Peter
or Peter&#39;s happiness, and that she would not marry
him except as a makeshift. For Miss Colebrooke
wrote verses; Peter had a white-and-gold volume of
them that Judith fancied he said his prayers to.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As for Peter himself, he had never been able to
explain the magic Kitty had brewed for him. There
was a heady quality in the very ring of her name.
His first glimpse of her, on Class Day, in a white
gown and a hat that to his manly indiscrimination
looked as guileless as a sheaf of poppies nodding
above the pale-yellow hair that had the sheen of
corn-silk, had been a vision that stirred in him
heroic promptings. He had no difficulty in securing
an introduction. She was a connection of the
Wetmores, as was he, though through opposite
sides of the house. In the few minutes&#39; talk that
followed, he had the disconcerting sensation of
being "talked down to." There was the indulgent
tolerance of the woman of the world to the "nice
boy" about this amazing young woman, who might
have been eighteen. Hamilton had repudiated the
very suggestion of being a "nice boy." But he
felt himself blushing, groping for words, saying
stupid things, supplying every requisite of the
"nice boy" as if he were acting the part. Her
chaperon bore her away presently, and he was left
with a radiant impression of corn-silk hair and a
complexion that justified Bouguereau&#39;s mother-of-pearl
<span class="tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span>
<a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
flesh tints. And when she had tilted the
ruffled lace parasol over her shoulder, so that it
framed her head like a fleecy halo, he had seen that
her eyes were green as jade. Withal he had a sense
of having acquitted himself stupidly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Later, when he ran the gamut of some friends,
they had chaffed him on his hardihood. By Jove!
He had nerve to look at her! Didn&#39;t he know she
was "the" Miss Colebrooke? Now Hamilton was
absolutely ignorant of Miss Colebrooke&#39;s right of
way to the definite article, but it was characteristic
of him to make no inquiries. On the whole, he
found the situation meeting with a greater number
of the artistic requirements than such situations
usually presented. He was still dallying with this
pleasant vagueness of sensation when he picked up
a copy of a magazine, and the name Katherine
Colebrooke caught his eye and held it like the
flight of a comet. Her contribution was a sonnet
entitled "The Miracle." As a naïve emotional confession,
"The Miracle" interested him; as a sonnet,
he rent it unmercifully.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter was to learn, however, that this sonnet was
but a solitary flake in a poetic fall of more or less
magnitude. He rather conspicuously avoided a
reference to her poetry when they met again. To
him it was the very least of her gifts. Her hair, that
had the tender yellow of ripening corn, was worthy
a cycle of sonnets, but pray leave the making of
them to some one else! By daylight the jade-colored
eyes seemed to shut out the world. The
pupils shrank to pin-points. The green looked
<span class="tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span>
<a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
deep—as many fathoms as the sea. She was all
Diana by daylight, a huntress, if you will, of the
elusive epithet, but essentially a maiden goddess,
who would add no sprightly romance to the chronicles
of Olympus. By lamp-light she suggested
quite another divinity. The pin-points expanded;
they burned black, like coals newly breaking into
flame.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When Hamilton knew her better, he did not like
to think that he had thought her eighteen at their
first meeting. It impugned his judgment as a man
of the world. Young ladies of eighteen could not
possibly be contributors of several years&#39; standing
to the various magazines. Disconcerting scraps of
gossip floated to him. He heard of her as bridesmaid
at a famous wedding of six years back, when
she had deflected the admiration from the bride and
remained the central figure of the picture. Her
portrait by Sargent had been the sensation of the
Salon when he had been a grubby-faced boy with
his nose in a Latin grammar. An unusual situation
was abhorrent to him. That he should marry an
older woman, one, moreover, who had gained her
public in a field to which he had not gained admission,
was doubly distasteful by reason of his
deference to the conventional. If she had flirted
with him, his midsummer madness would have
evaporated into thin air; but she kept him at arm&#39;s-length,
ostensibly took him seriously, and the boy
proposed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Her rejection of him was a matter of such consummate
skill that Hamilton did not realize the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span>
<a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
keenness of his disappointment till he was swinging
westward over the prairies. She had confided to
him that her work claimed her and that she must
renounce those sweet responsibilities that made the
happiness of other women. It was with the protective
mien of one who sought to shield him from
an adverse destiny that she declined his suit.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This had all happened seven years ago. In the
mean time he had adjusted his disappointment to
the new life of the West. To say that he had fallen
in love with the situation would be to misrepresent
him. But the rôle of lonely cow-puncher loyally
wedded to the thought of his first love was not without
charm to Peter. How long his constancy would
have survived the test of propinquity to a woman
of Judith Rodney&#39;s compelling personality, other
things being equal, it would be difficult to hazard
a guess. The coming of Judith from the convent
increased the perspective into which Kitty was retreating.
With the vivid plainswoman in the
foreground, the pale-haired writer of verse dwindled
almost to reminiscence. But the reverence for the
usual, that made up the underlying motive for so
much of Hamilton&#39;s conduct, presented barriers
alongside of which his previous quandary regarding
Miss Colebrooke&#39;s seniority shrank to insignificance.
He might marry a woman older than himself and
swallow the grimace of it, but by no conceivable
system of argument could he persuade himself to
marry into a family like that of the Rodneys—the
girl herself, for all her beauty and rare
womanliness, a quarter Indian, her father the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span>
<a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
synonyme for obloquy, her brother a cattle thief.
Hamilton preferred that other men should make the
heroic marriages of a new country. He was prepared
to applaud their hardihood of temperament,
but in his own case such a thing was inconceivable.
Similar arguments have ensnared multitudes in the
web of caution and provided a rich feast for the
arch-spider, convention, the shrivelled flies dangling
in the web conveying no significance, apparently,
beyond that of advertising the system.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When Peter went East, he had expected to find
Kitty worn by the pursuit of epithets, haunted by
the phantom of a career, resigned to the slings and
arrows of remorseful spinsterhood. An obvious
regret, or, at least, resignation tempered with remembrance,
was the unguent he anticipated at the
hands of Kitty. But alas for sanctuaries built to
refuge wounded pride! He found Kitty the pivot of
an adoring coterie, the magazines flowing with the
milk and honey of her verse and she looking younger,
if possible, than when he had first known her.
Time, experience, even the pangs of literary parturition
had not writ a single character on that
alabaster brow. The very atrophy of the forces
of time which she had accomplished by unknown
necromancy seemed to endow her with an elfin
youth, making her seem smaller, more childlike,
more radiantly elusive than when she had worn the
poppy hat at Cambridge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The tan and hardship of the prairie had adjusted
the blunder of their ages. Stark conditions had
overdrawn his account perhaps a decade; she retained
<span class="tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span>
<a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a surplus it would be rude to estimate. Her
greeting of him was radiant, her welcome panoplied
in words that verged close to inspiration. A woman
would have scented warning instantly, deep feeling
and the curled and perfumed phrase being suspicious
cronies and sure to rouse those lightly slumbering
watch-dogs, the feminine wits. But Peter only
turned the other cheek. More than once, in the
days that followed, he devoutly thanked his patron
saint, caution, that his relations with Judith had been
governed by characteristic prudence. Kitty admitted
him to her coterie, but he had lost nothing
of his attitude of grand Turk towards her verses.
The sin be upon the heads of whomever took such
things seriously! The irony of fate that compelled
a class poet to punch cows may have tinctured his
judgment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A telegram recalled him to the ranch and prevented
a final leave-taking with Miss Colebrooke.
He made his adieux by letter, and they were frankly
regretful. Miss Colebrooke&#39;s reply mingled sorrow
in parting from her old friend with joy in having
found him. Her letter, a masterpiece of phrase-spinning,
presented to Peter the one significant fact
that she would not be averse to the renewal of his
suit. In reading her letter he made no allowance
for the fact that the lady had made a fine art of
saying things, and that her joy and regret at their
meeting and parting might have been reminiscent
of the printed passion that was so prominent a
feature of magazinedom. Her letters—the like of
them he had never seen outside printed volumes of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span>
<a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
letters that had achieved the distinction of classics—culminated
in the one that Judith had given him that
morning, announcing that unexpectedly she had
decided to join the Wetmore girls and would be
glad to see him at the ranch.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">That he had flown at her bidding, Judith knew.
What she would least have suspected was that
Miss Colebrooke had received her visitor as if his
breakneck ride across the desert had been in the
nature of an afternoon call. If Judith, knowing
what she did of this long-drawn-out romance, could
have known likewise of her knight&#39;s chagrin, would
she have pitied him?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Ignorant of the recent anticlimax, and with a
burden of many heavy thoughts, Judith was penetrating
a world of unleavened desolation. Beneath
the scourge of the noon-day sun the desert lay,
stripped of every illusion. Vegetation had almost
ceased, nothing but sun-scorched, dust-choked sage-brush
could spring from such sterility. The fruit
of desolation, it gave back to desolation a quality
more melancholy than utter barrenness. Glittering
in the sunlight, the beds of alkali gleamed leper
white; above them the agitated air was like the hot
waves that dance and quiver about iron at white
heat. From horizon to horizon the curse of God
seemed to have fallen on the land; it was as if,
cursing it, He had forgotten it, and left it as the
abomination of desolation. Judith scarce heeded,
her thoughts straying after first one then another
of the group that made up her little world—Peter
Hamilton, Kitty Colebrooke, Jim, his family—thoughts
<span class="tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span>
<a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
inconsequent as the dancing dust-devils
that whirled over that infinity of space, and, whirling,
disappeared and reappeared at some new corner
of the compass.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The trail that she must take to Jim&#39;s camp in the
mountain was known to but few honest men. Fugitives
from justice—the grave, impersonal justice
of the law, or the swift justice of the plains—found
there an asylum. And while they sometimes suffered,
in death by thirst or hunger, a sentence more
dreadful than the law of the land or the law of the
rope would have given them, the desert, like the sea,
seldom gave up her own. It was more than probable
that no woman except Alida Rodney had ever
taken that trail before, and reasonably certain that
no woman had ever taken it alone. Dolly, when she
saw the beds of alkali grow more frequent, and that
the trails of the range cattle turned back, sniffed the
lack of water in the air, slackened her pace, and turned
an interrogatory ear towards her mistress.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It&#39;s all right, old girl"; the gauntleted hand
patted the satin neck. "We&#39;re in for"—Judith
flung her head up and confronted the infinite
desolation yawning to the sky-line—"God knows
what."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dolly broke into a light canter; this evidently was
not an occasion for dawdling. There was a touch
of business about the way the reins were held that
made the mare settle down to work. But her flying
hoofs made little apparent progress against the
space and silence of the desert. Five, ten, fifteen
miles and the curving shoulder of the mountain,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span>
<a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that she must cross, still mocked in the distance.
Only the sun moved in that vast world of seemingly
immutable forces.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There was no stoic Sioux in Judith now. The
girl that breasted the crests of the foot-hills shrank
in terror from the loneliness and the suggestion of
foes lurking in ambush. The sun dropped behind
the mountain, leaving a blood-red pool in his wake,
like fugitive Cain. Already night was sweeping
over the earth from mountain shadows that flowed
imperceptibly together like blackened pools. To
the girl following the trail the silence was more
dreadful than a chorus of threatening voices. She
listened till the stillness beat at her ears like the
stamping of ten thousand hoofs, then pulled up her
horse, and the desert was as still as the chamber
of death.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ah, Dolly, my dear, a house is the place for
women folk when the night comes—a house, the fire
burning clear, the kettle singing, and—" Dolly
whinnied an affirmative without waiting for the
picture to be completed. The wilderness was being
gradually swallowed by the shadows, as deliberately
as a snake swallows its victim. They were nearing
the mountains. The hot blasts of air from the
desert blew more and more intermittently. The
breeze swept keen from the hills, towering higher
and higher, and Judith breathed deep of the piny
fragrance and felt the tension of things loosen a
little.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Whitening cattle bones gleamed from the darkness,
tragic reminders of hard winters and scant pasturage,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span>
<a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Judith, with the Indian superstition that was
in the marrow of her bones, read ghostly warnings
in the empty eye-sockets of the grinning skulls
that stared up at her. She dared not think of
the dangers that the looming darkness might conceal,
or of what she might find at her journey&#39;s
end, or—"Whoa, Dolly! softly, girl. Is it my
foolish, white-blood nerves, or is some one following?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The mare had been trained to respond to the
slightest touch on her mouth, and stopped instantly.
Judith swayed slightly in the saddle with the
heaving of the sweating horse. The blood beat at
her temples, confusing what she actually heard with
what her imagination pictured. She was half-way
up a towering spur of the Wind River when she slid
from the saddle, and putting her ear to the ground
listened, Indian fashion. Above the throbbing stillness
of the desert night, that came to her murmurously,
like the imprisoned roar of the sea from a
shell, she could hear the regular beat of horse&#39;s hoofs
following up the steep mountain grade. She
scrambled up with the desperate nimbleness of a
hunted thing, but when she attempted to vault to
the saddle her limbs failed and she sank clinging to
the pommel. Twice she tried and twice the trembling
of her limbs held her captive. With the loss
of each moment the beat of the hoofs on the trail
below became more distinct. The very desperation
of her plight kept her clinging to the pommel, incapable
of thought, so that when she finally flung
herself to the saddle she was surprised to find herself
<span class="tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span>
<a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
there. To the left the trail dropped sharply
to a precipice, choked by the close crowding of
many scrub pines. To the right the snow-clad
spires of the Wind River kept their eternal vigil.
If she should call aloud for help, these white,
still mountains would echo the anguish of her
woman&#39;s cry and give no further heed to her
plight.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The trail had begun to widen. The horse behind
her again stumbled, loosening a stone that rolled
with crashes and echoings down to the precipice
below. She took advantage of the widening of the
trail to urge Dolly forward. Her impulse was to
put spurs to the mare and run, to take chances with
loose stones, a narrowing trail, and the possibility
of Dolly&#39;s stumbling and breaking a leg; but discretion
prompted the showing of a brave front, the
pleasantries of the road, with flight as the last
resource of desperation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Suddenly gaining what seemed to be a plateau,
she wheeled and waited the coming of this possible
friend or foe. The thudding of hoofs through the
inferno of darkness stopped, as the rider below considered
the latest move of the horseman above.
They were so near that Judith could hear the
labored breathing of the sweating horse. The blackness
of the night had become a tangible thing. The
towering mountains were one piece with the gaping
precipice, the trail, the scrub pines, the gauntlet
on her hand. The horse below resumed its stumbling
gait. Judith crowded Dolly close to the rocky
wall. If the chance comrade of the wilderness
<span class="tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span>
<a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
should pass her by in the darkness—God speed
him!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What the devil are you blocking the trail for?"
sung out a voice from the darkness. At sound of it
Judith&#39;s heart stopped beating. The voice was
Peter Hamilton&#39;s.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span>

<a name="toc_12" id="toc_12"></a>
<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">The Cabin In The Valley</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">And Judith, taken unawares by the unexpected
turn of things, comforted as a lost child that is
found, told all her feeling for him in the way she
called his name. The easy tenderness of the man
awoke; his senses swayed to the magic of her voice,
the mystery of the night, the shadow world in which
they two, &#39;twixt earth and sky, were alone. They
rode without speaking. Peter&#39;s hand sought hers,
and all her woman&#39;s terror of the desolation, her
fear of the vague terrors of the dreadful night,
spoke in her answering pressure. It was as if the
desert had given them to each other as they groped
through the silent darkness. In the great company
of earth, sky, silence, and this great-hearted woman,
Peter grew conscious of a real thrill. There were
depths to life—vast, still depths; this woman&#39;s unselfish
love for him made him realize them. He
felt his soul sweeping out on the great tide of things.
Farther and farther it swept; his patron saint,
caution, beckoning frantically from the receding
shore, was miles behind. "Judith!" he said, and he
scarce recognized his own voice. "Judith!" he
struggled as a swimmer in a drowning clutch.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span>
<a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Then his patron saint threw him a life-line and he
saved the situation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Judith!" he said, a third time, and now he knew
his voice. It was the voice of the man who tilted
at life picturesquely in a broad-brimmed hat, who
loved his darling griefs and fitted them as a Rembrandt
fits its background. And still, in the same
voice, the voice he knew, he said: "I feel as if we
had died and our souls were meeting. You know
Aldrich&#39;s exquisite lines:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">"Somewhere in desolate, wind-swept space,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8em" class="tei tei-l">In twilight land—no man&#39;s land—</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">Two hurrying shapes met face to face</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8em" class="tei tei-l">And bade each other stand.</p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">"&#39;And who are you?&#39; cried one, agape,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8em" class="tei tei-l">Shuddering in the gloaming light.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">I know not,&#39; said the other shape,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">&#39;I only died last night.&#39;"</p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;I only died last night!&#39;" she repeated the line,
slowly, significantly. In her questioning she forgot
the night, the desolation, the presence of the
man. Had she died last night? Had youth, the
joy of living, her infinite capacity for love, had they
died when Peter, with the ugly haste of the man without
a nice sense of the time that should elapse between
the old and the new love, had spurred away
cheerfully at the beck of another woman? And
now the desert, this earth-mother as she called it,
in the Indian way, had given him back to her,
thrown them together as driftwood in the still
ocean of space. She drew a long breath, the breath
<span class="tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span>
<a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of one waking from an anguished dream. A wild,
unreasoning gladness woke in her heart, the joy of
living swept her back again to life. She had not
died last night, she was riding through the wilderness
with Peter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Look!" she whispered. The sky had lost its
forbidding blackness. The sharp notches of the
mountains, faintly outlined in white, undulated
through an eternity of space. Venus hung in the
west, burning softly as a shaded lamp. The trail
they climbed seemed to end in her pale yellow light.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter had saved the situation, but the wild beauty
of the night stirred in him that gift of silvery speech
that was ever his tribute to the sex, rather than
the woman. He bent towards Judith. A loosened
strand of her hair blew across his cheek. The
breakneck ride to Kitty was already the madness
of a dead and gone incarnation. He pointed to the
pale star, and told her it was the omen of their
destiny; the formless blackness through which they
had groped was the way of life, but for such as were
not condemned to eternal darkness Venus held
high her lamp and they scaled the heights.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And Judith, listening, found her heart a battle-field
of love and hate. "Were women dogs, that
men should play with them in idle moods, caress
them, and fling them out for other toys?" she demanded
of herself, even while the tones of his voice
melted her innermost being to thankfulness for this
hour that he was wholly hers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Gayly, with ready turns of speech and snatches
of song, trolled in his musical barytone, Peter rode
<span class="tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span>
<a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
through the night, even as he rode through life, a
Sir Knight of the Joyous Heart, unbrushed by the
wing of sorrow, loving his pale griefs for the values
they gave the picture. And Judith understood by
reason of that exquisite perception that was hers in
all matters pertaining to him, and, knowing, only
loved the more.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Down the valley came the sharp yelp of a coyote,
and in a moment the towering crags had taken it up,
the echo repeating it and giving it back to the valley,
where the coyote barked again at the shadow of
his voice. The night was full of the eerie laughter.
Peter put a restraining hand on Dolly&#39;s bridle, and,
waiting for the coyote to stop, called Judith&#39;s name,
and all the mountains made music of it. The echo
sang the old Hebrew name as if it had been a psalm.
Peter&#39;s voice gave it to the mountains joyously, but
the mountains gave it back in the minor. And
Judith was reminded of the soft, singing syllables
that her mother, in the Indian way, had made of
her daughter&#39;s Indian name. The remembrance
tugged at her heart. In her joy at seeing Peter
she had forgotten that the errand that had brought
her was an errand of life and death—life and death
for her brother!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But Peter&#39;s ready enthusiasms pressed him hard.
Surely love-making was the business of such a night.
"Ah, Judith, goddess of the heights, if I could sing
your name like the mountains, would you love me a
little?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For his pains he had a flash of white teeth in a
smile that recalled his first acquaintance with Kitty,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span>
<a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the sort of smile one would give to a "nice boy"
when his manoeuvres were a trifle obvious. "Not
if you sang my name as the chorus of all the Himalayas
and the Rockies and Andes, and with the fire
of all their volcanoes and the beauty of their snows
and the strength of all their hills, for it&#39;s not my way
to love a little!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He bent towards her; to brush her cheek lightly
as they rode was but to imply his appreciation of
the scene as a bit of chiaroscuro, the panorama of
the desert night, eternal romance typified by the
man and woman scaling the heights, the goddess of
love lighting them on their way by her flaming
torch. But Judith, who said little because she felt
much, was in no mood to brook such dalliance, and,
urging the mare sharply, she cantered down the
divide at peril of life and limb. Peter, cursing
the heavy-footed beast he rode, came stumbling
after.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith rode wildly through the night, leaving
Peter laps behind, to beseech, to prophesy dire
happening if she should slip, and to scramble after,
as best he might, on the heavy-footed beast he
repudiated, with all his ancestors, as oxen, to the
fourth generation. But the woman kept her pace.
She had stern questions to put to herself, and they
were likely to have truer answers if Peter were
elsewhere than riding beside her. Whither was he
going? They had met casually on a trail known
to few honest men. It led over a spur of the Wind
River to a sort of no man&#39;s land, the hiding-place
of horse and cattle thieves. She had gone to warn
<span class="tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span>
<a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
her brother. Could he be going there—She could
not bring herself to finish.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Her heart was divided against itself. Within it
were fought again the red and the white man&#39;s
battles, bitterly, and to the finish. And now the
white man, with his open warfare, won, and all
her love rose up and scourged her little faith. She
would wait on the trail for Peter, penitent and
ashamed. And while she waited suspicions bred
of her Indian blood stirred distrustfully, and she
told herself that her mother&#39;s daughter made a
worthy champion of the ways of white men. Did
Hamilton hunt her brother gallowsward, making
merry with her the meantime? He had not even
been courteously concerned as to where she was
going when they met on the divide. They had met
and ridden together as casually as if it had been
the most natural thing for them both to be taking
the horse-thief trail as a summer evening&#39;s ride.
And she had not thought to wonder at his possible
destination, when the man from whom she rode in
terror through the night proved to be Peter, because
the lesser question of his errand had been swallowed
up in the greater miracle of his presence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She was by this time well down the divide. The
temperature had risen perceptibly on the down
grade. The heat of the plains had already mingled
with the cool hill air; the heights, where Venus
kept her love vigil, were already past. Judith gave
Dolly a breathing spell, herself lounging easily meanwhile.
She knew how to take her ease in the saddle
as well as any cow-puncher on the range.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span>
<a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The Hayoka has dominion over me," she mused,
with Indian fatalism. "As well resign myself to
sorrow with dignity. Hayoka, Hayo—ka!" and
she began to croon softly a hymn of propitiation
to the Hayoka, the Sioux god of contrariety. According
to the legends, he sat naked and fanned himself
in a Dakota blizzard and huddled, shivering,
over a fire in the heat of summer. Likewise the
Hayoka cried for joy and laughed for sorrow.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She remembered how the nuns at Santa Fé had
been shocked at her for praying to Indian gods, and
how once she had built a little mound of stones,
which was the Sioux way of making petition, in the
shadow of the statue of the Virgin Mary, and how
Sister Angela had scattered the stones and told her
to pray instead to the Blessed Lady. She still
prayed to the Blessed Lady every day; but sometimes,
too, she reared little mounds of stones in the
desert when she was very sad and the kinship between
her and the dead gods of her mother&#39;s people
seemed the closer for their common sorrow.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter, coming up with a much-blown horse, found
her still chanting the Indian song.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Sing him a verse for me, Judith. Heaven knows
I need something to straighten out my infernal luck.
Tell the Hayoka that I&#39;m a good fellow and need
only half a chance. Tell him to prosper my present
venture."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She had begun to chant the invocation, then
stopped suddenly. "I must not; you know I am a
Catholic." Suspicion that had been scotched, not
killed, raised its head. "What was his present
<span class="tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span>
<a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
venture?" Her eye had not changed in expression,
nor a tone of her voice, but in her heart was a sickening
distrust for all things.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A belated moon had come up. The level plain,
on which their horses threw grotesque, elongated
shadows, was flooded with honey-colored light. Each
straggling clump of sage-brush, whitening bone and
bowlder, gleamed mysterious, ghostly in the radiant
flood-tide. They seemed to be riding through a
world that had no kinship with that black, formless
void through which they had groped but yet a little
while. Then darkness had been upon the face of the
deep. Now there was a miracle of light such as
only the desert, in its desolation, knows. To Judith,
with a soul attuned to every passing expression of
nature, there was significance in this transition from
darkness to light. The sudden radiance was emblematic
of her belated perception, coming as it
did after a blindness so dense as to appear almost
wilful. Her mind was busy with a multitude of
schemes. Fool though she had been, she would
not be the instrument of her brother&#39;s undoing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;ve come too far," she cried, in sudden dismay.
"I should have stopped at the foot of the divide.
I&#39;ve never been over the trail before."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You foolish child, why should you stop in the
middle of the wilderness?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She wheeled the mare about and faced him, a
figure of graven resolution.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I promised to meet Tom Lorimer there—now
you know."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">With which she cracked Dolly sharply with her
<span class="tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span>
<a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
heel and began to retrace her way over the trail.
Peter turned his horse and followed, with the feeling
of utter helplessness that a man has when confronted
with the granite obstinacy of women. Judith
had meanwhile expected that the announcement of
her mythical appointment with Tom Lorimer would
be received differently. Tom Lorimer&#39;s reputation
was of the worst. An Eastern man formerly, an
absconder from justice, rumor was busy with tales
of ungodly merrymaking that went on at his ranch,
where no woman went except painted wisps from
the dance-halls. But Peter was too loyal a friend,
despite his shortcomings as a lover, to see in Judith&#39;s
statement anything more than a sisterly devotion
so deeply unselfish that it failed to take into account
the danger to which she subjected herself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">However, it was plainly his duty to prevent an
unprotected rendezvous with Lorimer, to reason, to
plead, and, if he should fail to bring her to a reasonable
frame of mind, to go with her, come what would
of the result. There were reasons innumerable
why he, a cattle-man, should avoid the appearance
of dealing with the sheep faction, he reflected,
grimly. Lorimer owned sheep, many thousand head.
His herds had been allowed to graze unmolested,
while smaller owners, like Jim Rodney, had been
crowded out because his influence, politically, was a
thing to be reckoned with. So Peter followed
Judith, pleading Judith&#39;s cause; she did not understand,
he told her, what she was doing; and while
perhaps there was not another man in the country
who would not honor her unselfishness in coming to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span>
<a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him, Lorimer&#39;s chivalry was not a thing to be reckoned
with, drunken beast that he was. And Judith,
worn with the struggle, tried beyond measure,
made reckless by the daily infusion of ill-fortune,
pulled up the mare and laughed unpleasantly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You think I&#39;m going to see Lorimer about Jim?
I&#39;m going with him to a merrymaking. We&#39;re old
pals, Lorimer and I."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Judith, dear, has it come to this, that you not
only distrust an old friend, but that you try to
degrade yourself to hide from him the fact that you
are going to your brother&#39;s? You&#39;ve never spoken
to Lorimer. I heard him say, not a week ago, that
he had never succeeded in making you recognize
him. You deceived me at first when you spoke of
meeting him—I thought you had a message from
Jim—but this talk of merrymaking is beneath you."
He shrugged his shoulders in disgust. He felt the
torrent of grief that rent her. No sob escaped her
lips; there was no convulsive movement of shoulder.
She rode beside him, still as the desert before the
sand-storm breaks, her soul seared with white-hot
iron that knows no saving grace of sob or tear. She
rode as Boadicea might have ridden to battle; there
was not a yielding line in her body. But over and
over in her woman&#39;s heart there rang the cry: "I
am so tired! If the long night would but come!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter drew out his watch. "It&#39;s a quarter to
eleven. We&#39;ll have a hard bit of riding to reach
Blind Creek before midnight."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then he knew as well as she, perhaps better, the
route to Jim&#39;s hiding-place; she had never been
<span class="tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span>
<a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
there as yet. And if Peter knew, doubtless every
cattle-man in the country knew. What a fool she
had been with her talk of meeting Tom Lorimer!
A sense of utter defeat seemed to paralyze her
energies. She felt like a trapped thing that after
eluding its pursuers again and again finds that it
has been but running about a corral. Physical
weariness was telling on her. She had been in the
saddle since a little past noon and it was now not far
from midnight. And still there was the unanswered
question of Peter&#39;s errand. It was long since either
had broken the silence. A delicious coolness had
crept into the air with the approach of midnight.
Judith, breathing deep draughts of it, reminded
herself of the stoicism that was hers by birthright.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Peter"—her voice lost some of its old ring, but
it had a deeper note—"Peter, we make strange
comrades, you and I, in a stranger world. We
meet on Horse-Thief Trail, and there is reason to
suppose that our errands are inimical. You&#39;ve
pierced all my little pretences; you know that I am
going to my brother, who is an outlaw—my brother,
the rope for whose hanging is already cut. And
yet we have been friends these many years, and we
meet in this world of desolation and weigh each
other&#39;s words, and there is no trust in our hearts.
Our little faith is more pitiful than the cruel errands
that bring us. I take it you, too, are going to my
brother&#39;s?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;m going there to see that you arrive safe and
sound, but I had no intention of going when I left
camp. You&#39;ve brought me a good twenty miles out
<span class="tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span>
<a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of my way, not to mention accusing me of ulterior
motives. Now, aren&#39;t you penitent?" He smiled
at her, boyish and irresistible. To Judith it was
more reassuring than an oath. "It&#39;s like dogs
fighting over a picked bone; the meat&#39;s all gone.
The range is overworked; it needs a good, long
rest." He turned towards Judith, speaking slowly.
"What you have said is true. We&#39;re friends
before we&#39;re partisans of either faction. I&#39;m on
my way to a round-up. There&#39;s been an unexpected
order to fill a beef contract—a thousand
steers. We&#39;re going to furnish five hundred, the
XXX two hundred and fifty, and the "Circle-Star"
two hundred and fifty. Men have been scouring
the enemy&#39;s country for days rounding up stragglers.
It will go hard with the rustlers after this round-up,
Judith."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She felt a great wave of penitence and shame
sweep over her. She had not trusted him; in her
heart she had nourished hideous suspicions of him,
and he was telling her, quite simply, of the plans of
his own faction, trusting her, as, indeed, he might,
but as she never expected to be trusted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Peter, do you know that sometimes I think
Jim has gone quite mad with these range troubles.
He&#39;s acted strangely ever since his sheep were driven
over the cliff. He&#39;s not been home to Alida and the
children since he has been out of jail, and you
know how devoted to them he has always been!
He spends all his time tracking Simpson. Alida
wrote me that she expects him to-night, and I&#39;m
going there on the chance."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span>
<a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It&#39;s the devil&#39;s own hole for desolation that he&#39;s
come to." Peter looked about the cup-shaped
valley that was but a <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">cul-de-sac</span> in the mountains.
Its approach was between the high rock walls of a
cañon. Passing between them, the rise of temperature
was almost incredible. The great barrier of
mountain-range, that cut it off from the rest of
the world, seemed also to cut it off from light and
air. The atmosphere hung lifeless, the occasional
bellow of range-cattle sounded far-off and muffled.
Vegetation was scant, the sage-brush grew close and
scrubby, even the brilliant cactus flowers seemed
to have abandoned the valley to its fate. A lone
group of dead cotton-woods grew like sentinels close
to the rocky walls. Their twisted branches, gaunt
and bare, writhed upward as if in dumb supplication.
There was about them a something that made
Judith come closer to Peter as they passed them
by. The night wind sang in their leafless branches
with a long-drawn, shuddering sigh. The despair of
a barren, deserted thing seemed to have settled on
them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Those frightful trees, how can Alida stand
them?" She looked back. "Oh, I wish they were
cut down!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Before them was the cabin, its ruined condition
pitifully apparent even by night. It had been
deserted ten years before Jim brought his family
to it. Rumor said it was haunted. Grim stories
were told of the death of a woman who had come
there with a man, and had not lived to go away
with him. The roof of the adjoining stable had
<span class="tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span>
<a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fallen in, the bars of the corral were missing. The
house was dark but for a feeble light that glimmered
in one window, the beacon that had been lighted,
night after night, against Jim&#39;s coming. It added
a further note of apprehension, peering through the
dark, still valley like a wakeful, anxious eye, keeping
a long and unrewarded vigil. Judith felt the
consummation of the threatening tragedy after her
first glimpse of the sentinel trees. She could not
explain, but her heart cried, even as the wind in
them had sung of death. Perhaps her mother&#39;s
spirit spoke to her, just as she had said, on that
memorable drive, that the Great Mystery spoke to
his people in the earth, the sky, and the frowning
mountains.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Peter"—she had slid from her horse and was
clinging to his arm—"when it happens, Peter, you
will have no part in it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It won&#39;t happen, Judith, if I can help it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She kissed his hand as it held the loose reins.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Lord, I am not worthy!" was the thought in his
heart. He sat graven in the saddle. Sir Knight of
the Joyous Heart though he was, the unsought kiss
of trust gifted him with a self-reverence that would
not soon forsake him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith was rapping on the door and calling to
Alida not to be frightened. And presently it was
opened. Peter wanted to leave Judith, now that she
was safely at the end of her journey, but she would
not hear of it till he had eaten.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You would have had your comfortable supper
five hours ago had you not been playing cavalier
<span class="tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span>
<a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to me all over the wilderness." And Peter
yielded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith busied herself about the kitchen. Her
mood of racking apprehension had disappeared.
Indian stoicism had again the guiding hand. She
waved Peter from the fire that she was kindling, as
if he were a blundering incompetent. But she let
him slice the bacon and grind the coffee as one
lets a child help. Alida came in, white-faced and
anxious over the long absence of her husband, but
conscientiously hospitable nevertheless. Peter noticed
that Judith made a gallant pretence of eating,
crumbling her bread and talking the meanwhile.
The pale wife, who had little to say at the best of
times, was put to the test to say anything at all.
But, withal, their intent was so genuinely hospitable
that Peter himself could not speak with the pity of
it. Accustomed as he was to the roughness of these
frontier cabins, never had he seen a human habitation
so desolate as this. The mud plaster had
fallen away from between the logs, showing cross
sections of the melancholy prospect. An atmosphere
of tragedy brooded over the place.
Whether from its long period of emptiness, or from
the vaguely hinted murder of the woman who had
died there, or whether it took its character from the
prevailing desolation, the cabin in the valley was an
unlovely thing. Nor did the cleanliness, the conscientious
making the best of things, soften the
woful aspect of the place. Rather was the appeal
the more poignant to the seeing eye, as the brave
makeshift of the self-respecting poor strikes deeper
<span class="tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span>
<a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
than the beggar&#39;s whine. The house was bare but
for the few things that Alida could take in the
wagon in which they made their flight. And all
through the pinch of poverty and grinning emptiness
there was visible the woman-touch, the brave making
the best of nothing, the pitiful preparation for
the coming of the man. Wild roses from the creek
bloomed against the gnarled and weather-warped
logs of the walls. Sprays of clematis trailed their
white bridal beauty from cans rescued from the
ashes of a camp-fire. But Alida was a strategist
when it came to adorning her home, and the rusty
receptacle was hid beneath trailing green leaves.
There was at the window a muslin curtain that in
its starched and ruffled estate was strongly suggestive
of a child&#39;s frock hastily converted into a
window drapery. The curtain was drawn aside
that the lamp might shed its beam farther on the
way of the traveller who came not. There was but
one other light in the place, a bit of candle. Alida
apologized for the poor light by which they must
eat, but she did not offer to take the lamp from the
window.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter was no longer Sir Knight of the Joyous
Heart as he watched the little, white-faced woman,
who went so often to the door to look towards the
road that entered the valley that she was no longer
aware of what she did. He saw her wide eyes full
of fear, the bow of the mouth strained taut with
anxiety, her unconscious fear of him as one of the
alien faction, and withal her concern for his comfort.
Judith&#39;s control was far greater, but though she
<span class="tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span>
<a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hid it skilfully, he knew the sorrow that consumed
her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There was a cry from the room beyond, and
Judith, snatching up the candle, went in to the
children. All three of them were sleeping cross-ways
in one bed, their small, round arms and legs
striking out through the land of dreams as swimmers
breasting the waves. She gave a little cry of delight
and appreciation, and called Peter to look.
Little Jim, who had cried in some passing fear, sat
up sleepily. He stretched out his small arms to
Peter, whom he had never seen before. Peter took
him, and again he settled to sleep, apparently assured
that he was in friendly hands.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The warm, small body, giving itself with perfect
confidence, strongly affected Peter&#39;s heightened
susceptibilities. In the very nature of the situation
he could be no friend to Jim Rodney, yet here in
his arms lay Jim Rodney&#39;s son, loving, trusting him
instinctively. Judith noticed that his face paled
beneath its many coats of tan. He was afraid of
the little sleeping boy, afraid that his unaccustomed
touch might hurt him, and yet loath to part with the
small burden. Judith took the boy from Peter and
placed him between the two little girls on the bed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Through the window they could see Alida&#39;s dress
glimmering, like a phantom in the darkness, as she
strained her eyes towards the path. Peter hated
to leave the women and children in this desolate
place. The night was far spent. To reach the
round-up in season, he could at best snatch a couple
of hours&#39; sleep and be again in the saddle while the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span>
<a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stars still shone. His saddle and saddle blanket
were enough for him. The broad canopy of heaven,
the bosom of mother earth, had given him sound,
dreamless sleep these many years. He bade the
women good-night, and made his bed where the
cañon gave entrance to the valley. But sleep was
slow to come. Now, in that vague, uncertain world
where we fall through oceans of space, and the
waking is the dream, the dream the waking, Peter
caught pale flashes of Kitty&#39;s gold head as she ran
and ran, ever in the pursuit of something, she knew
not what. And as she ran hither and thither, she
would turn her head and beckon to Peter, and as he
followed he felt the burden of years come upon him.
And then he saw Judith&#39;s eyes, still and grave. He
turned and wakened. No, it was not Judith&#39;s eyes,
but the stars above the mountain-tops.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span>

<a name="toc_13" id="toc_13"></a>
<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">The Round-up</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The stars were still shining when Peter Hamilton
looked at his watch next morning, but
he sternly fought the temptation to lie another two
minutes by remembering the day&#39;s work before
him, and went in search of the horse that he had
not picketed overnight, as the beast required a full
belly after the hard night&#39;s ride he had given him.
Peter had rolled out of his blankets with a keen
anticipatory relish for the day ahead. It was well,
he knew, that there was ample work of a definite
nature for Peter the cow-puncher; as for Peter
the man, he was singularly at sea. Had Judith
Rodney been his desert comrade all these cheerful
years for him to get his first belated insight into the
real Judith only a few little hours back? Or was it,
he wondered, her seeming unconsciousness of him,
as she rode brave and sorrowful through the night,
to avert, if might be, her brother&#39;s death—at all
events, to comfort and inspirit the frightened woman
and her little children—that had freshly tinged the
friendship he had so long felt for her? Many were
the questions that Peter vaguely put to himself as
he started out for his long day in the saddle; and
<span class="tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span>
<a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
none of them he answered. Indeed, he could not
satisfactorily explain to himself why he should think
of Judith at all in this way—Judith, whom he had
known so long, and upon whom he counted so
securely—Judith, who understood things, and was
as good a comrade as a man. Surely it was a
strange thing that he should discover himself in a
sentimental dream of Judith!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For it was in such dreams that Katherine Colebrooke
had figured ever since Peter could remember.
For years, indeed—and Judith knew it!—he had
stood, tame and tractable, waiting for Chloe to
throw her dainty lariat. But Chloe had intimated
that her graceful fingers were engaged with the
inkpot and her head with schemes for further
sonneting. Chloe was becoming famous. To Peter,
who was unmodern, there was little to be gained in
arguing against a state of affairs so crassly absurd
as career-getting for women. At such seasons it
behooved sane men to pray for patience rather
than the gift of tongues. When the disheartened
fair should weary of the phantom pursuit, then
might the man of patience have his little day.
Peter winced at the picture. To the world he
knew that his long waiting on the brink of the bog,
while his ambitious lady floundered after false lights,
was, in truth, no more impressive a spectacle than
the anguished squawking of a hen who watches a
brood of ducklings, of her own hatching, try their
luck in the pond.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And there was Judith the great-hearted, Judith
who was as inspiring as a breath of hill air, Judith
<span class="tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span>
<a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with no thought of careers beyond the loyal doing
of her woman&#39;s part, Judith, trusty and loyal—and
Judith with that accursed family connection!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter tightened his cinch and turned his horse
westward. The stars had grown dim in the sky.
The world that the night before had seemed to float
in a silvery effulgence looked gray and old. The
cabin in the valley flaunted its wretched squalor,
like a beggar seeking alms on the highway. Riding
by, Peter lifted his sombrero. "Sweet dreams,
gentle lady!" He dug the rowel into his horse&#39;s side
and began his day at no laggard pace. Nor did he
spare his horse in the miles that lay between him
and breakfast. The beast would have no more
work to do that day, when once he reached camp,
and Peter was not in his tenderest mood as he
spurred through the gray of the morning. The
pale, chastened world was all his own at this hour.
Not a creature was stirring. The mountains, the
valleys, the softly huddled hills slept in the deep
hush that is just before the dawn. He looked about
with questioning eyes. Last night this very road
had been a pale silver thread winding from the
mountain crests into a world of dreams. To-day
it was but a trail across the range. "Where are the
snows of yester year?" he quoted, with a certain
early-morning grimness. At heart he was half inclined
to believe Judith responsible for the vanished
world; Judith, Judith—he was riding away from
her as fast as his horse could gallop, and yet his
thoughts perversely lingered about the cabin in the
valley.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span>
<a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">After a couple of hours&#39; hard riding he could
dimly make out specks moving on that huge background
of space, and presently his horse neighed
and put fresh spirit into his gait, recognizing his
fellows in moving dots on the vast perspective.
And being a beast of some intelligence, for all his
heavy-footed failings, he reasoned that food and
rest would soon be his portion. Peter had no further
use for the rowel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Breakfast was already well under way when he
reached camp. The outfit, seated on saddles in a
semicircle about the chuck wagon, ate with that
peculiar combination of haste and skill that doubtless
the life of the saddle counteracts, as digestive
troubles are apparently unknown among plainsmen.
The cook, in handing Peter his tin plate, cup,
spoon, and black-handled fork, asked him if "he
would take overland trout or Cincinnati chicken,
this morning?" The cook never omitted these jocular
inquiries regarding the various camp names for
bacon. He seemed to think that a choice of alias
was as good as a change of menu. There was little
talk at breakfast, and that bearing chiefly on the
day&#39;s work. Every one was impatient for an early
start. The horse wrangler had his string waiting,
the cook was scouring his iron pots, saddles were
thrown over horses fresh from a long night&#39;s good
grazing, cinches were tightened, slickers and blankets
were adjusted, and camp melted away in a troup
of horsemen winding away through the gray of early
morning.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The scene of the beef round-up was a mighty
<span class="tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span>
<a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
plain, affording limitless scope for handling the
cattle of a thousand hills. In the distance rose the
first undulations of the mountains, that might be
likened to the surplusage of space that rolled the
length of the sweeping levels, then heaped high to
the blue. The specks in the far distance began to
grow as if the screw of a field-glass were bringing
them nearer, turning them into horsemen, bunches
of cattle, "chuck-wagons" of the different outfits,
reserves of horses restrained by temporary rope-corrals,
all the equipment of a great round-up.
Dozens of men, multitudes of horses, hordes of cattle—the
mighty plain swallowed all the little, prancing,
galloping, bellowing things, and still looked mighty
in its loneliness. Fling a handful of toys from a
Noah&#39;s Ark—if they make such simple toys now—in
an ordinary field, and the little, wooden men,
horses and cows, will suggest the round-up in relation
to its background. Men darted hither and thither,
yelling shrilly; cows—born apparently to be leaders—broke
from the bunches to which they had been
assigned and started at a clumsy run, followed by
kindred susceptible to example. Cow-punchers,
waiting for just such manifestations of individuality,
whirled after them like comets, and soon they were
again in the pawing, heaving, sweltering bunch to
which they belonged.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter Hamilton, whose particular skill as a cow-puncher
lay in that branch of the profession known
as "cutting out," found that the work of the rustlers
had been carried on with no unsparing hand since
the early spring round-up. Calves bearing the "H
<span class="tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span>
<a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
L" brand—that claimed by a company known to be
made up of cattle-thieves—followed mothers bearing
almost every brand that grazed herds in that
part of the State. The Wetmore outfit, that used a
"W" enclosed in a square, were apparently the
heaviest losers. The cows and calves were herded
at the right of the plain, convenient to the branding-pen,
the steers well away to the opposite side. As
Peter drove a "W-square" cow, followed by a little,
white-faced calf, whose brand had plainly been
tampered with, he heard one of his associates say:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There&#39;s nothing small about the &#39;H L&#39; except
their methods."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What&#39;s &#39;H L&#39; stand for, anyway?" the other
cow-puncher asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why, Hell, or, How Long; depends whether
you&#39;re with &#39;em or again &#39;em."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter wheeled from the men and headed for the
bunch he was cutting out. He fancied that the
man had looked at him strangely as he offered a
choice of meanings for the "H L"—and yet he
could not have known that Peter had gone to
Rodney&#39;s cabin last night. He flung himself heart
and soul into his work, dashing full tilt at the
snorting, stamping bedlam, enveloped in clouds of
dust that dimmed the very daylight. Calves bleated
piteously as they were jammed in the thickening
pack. Peter shouted, swung the rope right and
left, thinning the bunch about him, and a second
later emerged, driving before him a cow, followed
by a calf. These were turned over to cow-boys
waiting for them. Time after time Hamilton returned
<span class="tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span>
<a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to that mass of unconscious power, that with
a single rush could have annihilated the little band
of horsemen that handled them with the skill of a
dealer shuffling, cutting, dealing a pack of cards.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">To the left were the steers, pawing and tearing up
the earth in a very ecstasy of impotent fury. Picture
the giant propeller of an ocean liner thrashing about
in the sands of the desert and you will have an
approximate knowledge of the dust raised by a
thousand steers. Their long-drawn, shrieking bellow
had a sinister note. Horns, hoofs, tails beat the
air, their bloodshot eyes looked menacingly in every
direction; but a handful of cow-boys kept them in
check, circling round and round them on ponies who
did their work without waiting for quirt or rowel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The noonday sun looked down upon a scene that
to the eye unskilled in these things was as confusion
worse confounded. Cow-boys dashed from nowhere
in particular and did amazing things with a
bit of rope, sending it through the air with snaky
undulations after flying cattle. The rope, taking
on lifelike coils, would pursue the flying beast like
an aerial reptile, then the noose would fall true,
and the thing was done. A second later a couple
of cow-boys would be examining the disputed brand
on the prone animal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The smell of burning flesh and hair rose from the
branding-pen and mingled with the stench of the
herds in one noisome compound. The yells of the
cow-punchers, each having its different bearing on
the work in hand, were all but lost in the dull,
steady roar of the cattle, bellowing in a chorus of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span>
<a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fear, rage, and pain. And still the work of sorting,
branding, cutting-out, went steadily on. Though
an outsider would not have perceived it, the work
was as crisp-cut and exact in its methods as the
work in a counting-house. One of the cow-boys, in
hot pursuit of a fractious heifer, encountered a
gopher-hole, and horse and rider were down in a
heap. In a second a dozen helping hands were
dragging him from under the horse. He limped
painfully, but stooped to examine his horse. The
beast had broken a leg, and turned on the man eyes
almost human in their pain.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Bob, Bob!" The cow-puncher went down on
his knees and put his arms about the neck of his
pet. "My God!" he said, "me and Bob was just
like brothers. Everybody knowed that." He uncinched
the saddle with clumsy tenderness; not a man
thought a whit less of him because he could not see
well at the moment. He turned his head away, that
he might not see the well-aimed shot that would
release his pet from pain. Then he limped away
after another horse—it was all in the day&#39;s work.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The beef contract called for a thousand steers,
four and five years old, and these having been well
and duly counted, and some dozen extra head added
in case of accident, they were immediately started
on the trail, as they could accomplish some seven or
eight miles before being bedded down for the night.
Hamilton, who had crossed to the beef side of the
round-up to have a necessary word with the "Circle-Star"
foreman, was amazed to find Simpson making
ready to start with the trail herd. Peter inquired,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span>
<a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with a few expletives, "how long he had been a
cow-man, in good and regular standing?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"As far as the regularity is concerned, that would
be a pretty hard thing to answer, but he&#39;s had an
interest in the &#39;XXX&#39; since—since—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He drove Rodney&#39;s sheep over the cliff?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ain&#39;t you a little hard on the beginning of his
cattle career? It usually goes by a more business-like
name, but—" he shrugged his shoulders—"it&#39;s
up to the &#39;XXX.&#39; We wouldn&#39;t have him help
to pull bogged cattle out of a creek."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The beeves, hidden in a simoom of their own
stamping, were gradually being pressed forward on
the trail, a huge pawn, ignorant of its own strength,
manipulated by a handful of men and horses. Its
bellowing, like the tuning of a thousand bass-fiddles,
shook the stillness like the long, sullen roar
of the sea, as out of the plain they thundered, to
feed the multitude.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, there goes as pretty a bunch of porterhouses
as I&#39;d want to put tooth to. If I get away
from here within the next two months, as I&#39;m expecting,
doubtless I&#39;ll meet some of you again with
your personality somewhat obscured by reason of
fried onions."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The foreman of the "Circle-Star" waved his hand
after the slowly moving herd that gradually pressed
forward like an army in loose marching order. Outriders
galloped ahead, like darting insects, and pointing
the lumbering mass that trailed its half-mile
length at a snail&#39;s-pace. The great column steadily
advanced, checked, turned, led as easily as a child
<span class="tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span>
<a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
trails his little steam-cars after him on the nursery
floor, and always by the little force of a handful of
men and a few horses.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After supper came general relaxation around the
camp-fire. The men, who had all day been strung
to a keen pitch of nervous energy, lounged in loose,
picturesque uncouthness, while each began to unravel
his own lively miscellany of information or
invention. There was jest, laughter, spinning of
yarns, singing of songs. As Peter lay in the fire-light,
smoking his brier-wood, he noticed that the
man next him spent a great deal of time poring
over a letter, holding it close to the blaze, now at
arm&#39;s-length, which was hardly surprising, considering
the penmanship of the more common
variety of <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">billet-doux</span>. The man was plainly disappointed
that Peter would not notice or comment.
Finally he folded it up, and with sentimental significance
returned it to the left side pocket of his
flannel shirt, and remarked to Peter, "It&#39;s from
her."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Indeed," said Peter, who had not the faintest
notion who "her" could be. "Let me congratulate
you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, sir," and there was conviction in the cow-puncher&#39;s
tone; "it&#39;s from old man Kinson&#39;s girl, up
to the Basin, and the parson&#39;s goin&#39; to give us the
life sentence soon. A man gets sick o&#39; helling it all
over creation." He rolled a cigarette, lit it, took
a puff or two, then turned to Peter, as one whose
acquaintance with the broader side of life entitled
him to speak with a certain authority. "Is it that,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span>
<a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or is it that we&#39;re getting on, a little long in the
tooth, logy in our movements?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I think we&#39;re just sick of helling it." Peter
looked towards the star that last night had been
the beacon towards which he and Judith had
scaled the heights. "Yes, we get sick of helling it
after we&#39;ve turned thirty."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then I can&#39;t be making a mistake. If I thought
it was because I was getting on, I&#39;d stampede this
here range. It don&#39;t seem fair to a girl to allow
that you&#39;re broke, tamed, and know the way to the
corral, when it&#39;s just that you&#39;re needin&#39; to go to an
old man&#39;s home."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Now this is really love," said Peter to himself,
with interest. "This is humility." A sympathetic
liking for the self-distrustful lover surged hot and
generous into Peter&#39;s heart, and he continued to
himself: "Now that&#39;s what Judith would appreciate
in a man, some directness, some humility!" Poor
Judith! Poor burden-bearer! Who was to love
her as she deserved to be loved, even as old man
Kinson&#39;s girl, of the Basin, was loved? Yet suppose
some one did love her in such fashion and she returned
it? It was a picture Peter had never conjured
up before. Nonsense! he was accustomed to
think of Judith a great deal, and that was not the
way to think of her. "Dear Judith!" said Peter,
half unconsciously to himself, and looked again at
the fellow, who had gone back to his dingy letter and
continued to reread it in the fire-light as if he hoped
to extract some further meaning from the now
familiar words. Nature had fitted him out with a
<span class="tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span>
<a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rag-bag assortment of features—the nose of a clown,
the eyes of a ferret, the mouth that hangs agape
like a badly hinged door, the mouth of the incessant
talker. And withal, as he lounged in the fire-light,
dreamily turning his love-letter, he had a sort of
superphysical beauty, reflected of the glow that
many waters cannot quench.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Costigan, who had led the merriment against
Simpson at Mrs. Clark&#39;s eating-house, was playing
"mumbly-peg" with Texas Tyler. They had been
working like Trojans all day at the round-up, but
they pitched their pocket-knives with as keen a zest
as school-boys, bickering over points in the game,
accusing each other of cheating, calling on the
rest of the company to umpire some disputed
point.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But presently, from the opposite side of the fire,
some one began to sing, in a rich barytone, a dirgelike
thing that caught the attention of first one then
another of the men, making them stop their yarning
and knife-throwing to listen. The tune, in its homely
power to evoke the image of the ceremonial of
death, was more or less familiar to most of them.
There was a conscious funeral pageantry in the ring
of its measured phrases that recalled to many
burials of the dead that had taken place in their
widely scattered homes. Mrs. Barbauld&#39;s hymn,
"Flee as a Bird to the Mountain," are the words
usually sung to the air.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Costigan presently cut across the dirgelike refrain
with: "Phwat th&#39; divil is ut about that
chune that Oi&#39;m thinkin&#39; of?"</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span>
<a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"This," said the man with the barytone voice,
"is the tune that Nick Steele saved his neck to."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Begorra, that&#39;s ut. I wasn&#39;t there mesilf, but
Oi&#39;ve heard th&#39; story told more times than Oi&#39;ve
years to me credit."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"My father was in that necktie party," spoke up
a young cow-puncher, "and I&#39;ve heard him tell the
story scores of times, and he always wondered why
the devil they let Steele off. Never could understand
it after the thing was done. He was talking
of it once to a man who was a sharp on things like
mesmerism, and the man called it hypnotic suggestion.
Said that Steele got control of the whole
outfit and mesmerized &#39;em so they couldn&#39;t do a
thing to him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Several of the men asked for the story, echoes of
which had come down through all the forty years
since its happening. And the cow-puncher, lighting
a cigarette, began:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It was in the good old forty-nine days in
California, when gold was sometimes more plentiful
than bread, and women were so scarce that one
day when they found a girl&#39;s shoe on the trail they
fitted a gold heel to it and put it up in camp to
worship. But sentiment wasn&#39;t exactly their long
suit, and any little difficulties that cropped up were
straightened out by the vigilance committee—and
a rope. One day a saddle, or maybe it was a gun,
that didn&#39;t belong to him, was found among this
man Steele&#39;s traps, and though he swore that some
one had put it there for a grudge, the committee
thought that a hemp necktie was the easiest way
<span class="tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span>
<a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
out of the argument. And this here Steele party
finds himself, at the age of twenty-four, with something
like thirty minutes of life to his credit. He
don&#39;t take on none, nor make a play for mercy, nor
try any fancy speech-making. He just waits round,
kinder pale, but seemin&#39; indifferent, considerin&#39; it
was his funeral that was impendin&#39;. I&#39;ve heard
my father say that he was a tall, slim boy, with a
kind of girlish prettiness, and the committee looked
some for hysterics and they didn&#39;t get none. The
noose was made ready and they told Steele he could
have five minutes to pray, if he wanted to, or he
could take it out in cursing, just as he chose. The
boy said he felt that he hadn&#39;t quite all that was
coming to him in the way of enjoyment, and that
while he was far from criticising the vigilance
committee, he was not altogether partial to the
nature of his demise, and if it was just the same to
them, instead of praying or cursing, he&#39;d take that
five minutes for a song.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"They was agreeable, and he up and steps on the
scaffold, what they was mighty proud of, it bein&#39;
about the only substantial structure the town could
boast. He began to sing that thing you&#39;ve all
been listening to, and he had a voice like water
falling light and fine in a pool below. They crowded
up close about the scaffold and listened. The
words he put to it were his own story, just like those
old minstrels that you read about, and at the end
of each verse came the chorus, slow and solemn as
the moment after something great has happened.
There wasn&#39;t a hangin&#39;-face in the crowd after he
<span class="tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span>
<a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was started. At some time or other every man had
heard somebody he thought a heap of, buried to
that tune, and his voice got to workin&#39; on their
imaginations and turned their hearts to water. I
don&#39;t remember anything but the chorus—that went
like this:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">"&#39;Who&#39;ll weep for me, on the gallows tree,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8em" class="tei tei-l">As I sway in the wind and swing?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">Is there never a tear to be shed for me,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8em" class="tei tei-l">As I swing by a hempen string?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">Who&#39;ll weep, who&#39;ll keep</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">Watch, as I&#39;m rocked to sleep,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8em" class="tei tei-l">Rocked by a hempen string?&#39;"</p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">There was a long silence, broken only by the
crackle of the logs in the camp-fire and the night
sounds of the lonely plain. The leaping flames
showed a group of thoughtful faces. Finally, Costigan
broke the silence with:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Begorra, &#39;tis some av thim &#39;ud be doin&#39; well to
be lukin&#39; to their music-lessons about here, Oi&#39;m
thinkin&#39;, afther th&#39; day&#39;s wurruk."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The Irishman, with his instinctive loquacity, had
expressed what none of the rest would have considered
politic to hint. It was like the giving way
of the pebble that starts the avalanche. Soon they
were deep in tales of lynchings. Peter knew only too
well the trend of their talk, the "XXX" men were
feeling the public pulse, as it were. Now, according
to the unwritten code of the plains, lynching was
"meet, right, just, and available" for the cattle-thief.
And Peter felt himself false to his creed, false
<span class="tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span>
<a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to his employer, false to himself, in seeking to evade
the question. And yet that pitiful cabin, the white-faced
woman running to the door so often that
she knew not what she did, and the little rosy boy,
who had put out his arms so trustfully! Peter
broke into their grewsome yarning. "Lord, but
you&#39;re like a lot of old women just come from a
funeral!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Whin the carpse died hard, and th&#39; wake was
a success." Costigan turned over. "Werra, werra,
but we&#39;ll be seein&#39; fairies the night!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A "XXX" man turned his head with a deliberate
slowness and regarded Peter with narrowing eyes:
"If the subject of cattle-thieves and their punishment
is unpleasant to the gentleman from New
York, perhaps he will favor us with something more
cheerful." It was the same man who had given the
two definitions of the "H L" brand that morning
at the round-up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Delighted," said Peter, affecting not to notice
the significance of the man&#39;s remark. "Did you
ever hear of the time that Tony Neville was burned
with snow?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The "XXX" man yawned long and audibly.
No one seemed especially interested in Tony Neville&#39;s
having been burned with snow, but Peter struck
out manfully, just in time to head off a man who
said that he had seen Jim Rodney or some one
who looked like him, following the trail-herd.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Once on a time, when it paid to be a cattle-man,"
began Peter, "there was an outfit near Laramie that
hailed from the United Kingdom, every mother&#39;s
<span class="tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span>
<a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
son of them. A fine, manly lot of fellows, but
wedded to calamity along of their cooks—not the
revered range article," and Peter waved his hand
towards the "W-square" cook, who was one of the
party, "but the pampered ranch article that boasts
a real stove, planted in a real kitchen, the spoiled
darling that never has to light a fire out of wet wood
in the rain.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"These unhappy Britons had every species of ill
luck that could befall an outfit, in the way of cooks;
they were of every nationality, age, and sex, and they
stole, drank, quarrelled, till the outfit determined
to sweep the house clear of them and do its own
cooking. Every man was to have a turn at it for a
week. There was a Scotchman, who gave them
something called &#39;pease bannocks,&#39; three times a day;
followed by an Irishman, who breakfasted them
on potatoes and whiskey. There was an Englishman,
who had a beef slaughtered every time he
fancied a tenderloin. There was a Welshman, who
sang as he cooked. There were as many different
kinds of indigestion as there were men in the outfit.
They would beg to do night-herding, anything to get
them away from that ranch. Finally, when their
little tummies got so bad that their overcoats
thickened, or wore through, or whatever happens to
stomachs&#39; overcoats that are treated unkindly, some
one&#39;s maiden aunt sent him a tract saying that rice
was the salvation of the human race, as witness the
Chinese. Whosever turn it was to cook that week
determined to try the old lady&#39;s prescription. Rice
was procured, about a peck, I think; and the man
<span class="tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span>
<a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who was cooking, pro tem, put the entire quantity
on to boil in a huge ham-boiler, over a slow fire, as
per the directions of the maiden aunt. The rice
seemed to be doing nicely, when some one came in
and said that a bunch of antelope was over on the
hills and there was a good chance to get a couple.
Every man got his gun, all but the cook, and he
looked at the rice, that hadn&#39;t done a thing over
the slow fire, in a way that would melt your heart.
&#39;Just my luck that it should be my week to pot-wrestle
when there&#39;s good hunting right at one&#39;s
front door.&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Oh, come on,&#39; some one said. &#39;Didn&#39;t Kellett&#39;s
aunt say the rice ought to be cooked over a slow
fire? Kellett, get your aunt&#39;s letter and read the
directions for cooking that rice again.&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The cook didn&#39;t need a second invitation, and
they got into their saddles, cook and all, and went
for the antelope.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Now antelope are not like stationary wash-tubs;
they move about. And when that particular outfit
arrived at the spot where those antelope were
last seen, they had moved, but the boys found
traces of them, and continued on their trail. They
went in the foot-hills and they searched for those
antelope all day. They caught up with old man
Hall&#39;s outfit at dinner-time and were invited to take
a bite. Coming home by way of the &#39;Circle-Star&#39;
ranch, Colonel Semmes asked them in to have a
mint-julep; the colonel was a South Carolinian, and
he had just succeeded in raising some mint. They
had several—I fear more than several—drinks before
<span class="tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span>
<a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
leaving for home, with never a trace of antelope nor
a thought of the rice cooking over the slow fire.
The colonel remembered some hard cider that he
had, and topping off on that, they set out. The
weather was pretty warm, and on their way home
they experienced some remorse over the hard cider.
Now hard cider is an accumulative drink; it piles
up interest like debt or unpaid taxes. And by the
time those Englishmen had turned the little lane
leading into their home corral, they saw a sight that
made their sombreros rise. As I have said before,
it was hot, being somewhere in the month of August.
Gentlemen, I hardly expect you to believe
me when I say it was snowing on their house,
and not on another God blessed thing in the landscape.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The blame thing about it was, that every man
took the phenomenon to be his own private view
of snakes, or their bibulous equivalent, manifested
in another and more terrifying form. Here was the
August sun pouring down on the plain where their
ranch-house was situated; everything in sight hot
and dry as a lime-kiln, grasshoppers chirping in a
hot-wave prophecy, and snow covering the house
and the ground, about to what seemed a depth of
four inches. Every one of them felt sensitive about
mentioning what he saw to the others. You see,
gentlemen, being unfamiliar with American drinks,
and especially old Massachusetts cider, they merely
looked to keep their saddles and no questions
asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But when they got a bit closer the horror increased.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span>
<a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Flying right out of their windows were
perfect drifts of snow, banks of it, gentlemen, and
the thermometer up past a hundred. One of the
men looked about him and noticed the pallor on the
faces of the rest:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Do you notice anything strange, old chap?
These cursed American drinks!&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Strange!&#39;—the boy he had spoken to was about
eighteen, a nice, red-cheeked English lad out with
his uncle learning the cattle business. &#39;Good God!&#39;
the boy said. &#39;I&#39;ve always tried to lead a good
life, and here I am a paretic before I&#39;ve come of
age.&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"They halted their horses and held a consultation.
The boss came to the conclusion that since they
had all seen it, there was nothing to do but continue
the investigation and send the details to the
&#39;Society for Psychical Research,&#39; when he got down
from his horse and walked towards the door of the
house. At his approach, as if to rebuke his wanton
curiosity, a great blast of snow blew out of the
window and got him full in the face. He howled—the
snow was scalding hot.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then they remembered the rice."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Is that all?" demanded the man who had
wanted to talk about rustling.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Isn&#39;t it enough?" said Peter, who could afford
to be magnanimous, now that he had accomplished
his point.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"When I first heard that story, &#39;bout ten years
ago, it ended with the Britishers riding like hell
over to the Wolcott ranch to borrow umbrellas to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span>
<a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
keep off the hot rice while they got into the house,"
said the man, still sulky.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s the way they tell it to tenderfeet," and
Peter turned on his heel. The story-telling for the
evening was over, the boys got their blankets and
set about making their beds for the night.</p>

<a name="toc_14" id="toc_14"></a>
<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">Mary&#39;s First Day In Camp</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The first day spent as governess to the family
of Yellett reminded Mary Carmichael of those
days mentioned in the opening chapter of Genesis,
days wherein whole geological ages developed and
decayed. Any era, geological or otherwise, she felt
might have had its rise, decline, and fall during that
first day spent in a sheep camp.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She awoke to the sound of faint tinklings, and
accepted the towering peaks of the Wind River
mountains, with their snowy mantles all shadowy
in the whitening dawn, and the warmer grays of
huddling foot-hills, as one receives, without question,
the fantastic visions of sleep. The faint tinkling
grew nearer, mingled with a light pitter patter and
a far off baa-ing and bleating; then, as shadowy as
the sheep in dreams, a great flock came winding
round the hill; in and out through the sage-brush
they went and came, elusive as the early morning
shadows they moved among. The air was crystalline
and sparkling; creation&#39;s first morning could
not have promised more. It would have been inconsistent
in such a place to waken in a house; the
desert, that seemed a lifeless sea, the sheep moving
<span class="tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span>
<a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
like gray shadows, were all parts of a big, new world
that had no need of houses built by hands.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Ben, oldest of the Brobdingnag tribe, who had
greeted Mary&#39;s request to be directed to "the house"
as a bit of dry Eastern humor, led the herd to
pasture. Ben&#39;s right-hand man was "Stump,"
the collie, so named because he had no tail worth
mentioning, but otherwise in full possession of his
faculties. Stump was newly broken to his official
duties and authority sat heavily on him. Keenly
alert, he flew hither and thither, first after one
straying member of the herd, then another, barking
an early morning roll-call as he went. Two other
male Brobdingnags came from some sequestered spot
in the landscape and joined Ben—Mary recognized
two more pupils.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Yellett then unrolled the pillow constructed
the night previous of such garments as she had been
willing to dispense with, and put them on. The
vastness of her surroundings did not prevent her
from locating the minutest article, and Mary gave
her the respectful admiration of a woman who has
spent a great deal of time searching for things in an
infinitely smaller space. The matriarch then called
the remaining members of her household officially—the
Misses Yellett accomplished their early morning
toilets with the simplicity of young robins. Only
the new governess hung back, but finally mustered
up enough courage to say that if such
a thing was possible she would like to have a
bath.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Yellett greeted her request with the amused
<span class="tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span>
<a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tolerance of one who has never given such a trifle
a thought.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The habit of bathing," she commented, "is
shore like religion: them that observes it wonders
how them that neglects it gets along." She beckoned
Mary to follow, and led the way to a bunch of
willows that grew about a stone&#39;s-throw from the
camp. "Here be a whole creek full of water, if
you don&#39;t lack the fortitood. It&#39;s cold enough to
sell for ten cents a glass down to Texas."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Somewhat dismayed, Mary stepped gingerly into
the creek. Its intense cold numbed her at first,
but a second later awoke all her young lustiness, and
she returned to camp in a fine glow of courage to
encounter whatever else there might be of novelty.
Mrs. Yellett was preparing breakfast at a sheet-iron
stove, assisted by Cacta and Clematis.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Your hankering after a bath like this"—she added
another handful of flour to the biscuit dough—"do
shore remind me of an Englishman who come
to visit near Laramie in the days of plenty, when
steers had jumped to forty-five. This yere Britisher
was exhibit stock, shore enough, being what&#39;s called
a peer of the realm, which means, in his own country,
that he is just nacherally entitled from the start
to h&#39;ist his nose high.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The outfit he was goin&#39; to visit wasn&#39;t in the
habit of havin&#39; peers drop in on them casual, but
they aimed to make him feel that he wasn&#39;t the
first of the herd that headed that way by a
quart"—she cut four biscuits with a tin cup, and
resumed—"to which end they rounded up every
<span class="tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span>
<a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
specimen of canned food that&#39;s ever come across the
Rockies.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Let him ask for "salmon esplinade," let him
ask for "chicken marine-go," let him ask for
plum-pudding, let him ask for hair-oil or throat
lozengers, this yere outfit calls his bluff,&#39; says Billy
Ames, who owns the &#39;twin star&#39; outfit and is
anticipatin&#39; this peer as a guest.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, just as everything is ready, the can-opener,
sharp as a razor, waitin&#39; to open up such effete
luxuries as the peer may demand, Bill Ames gets
called to California by the sickness of his wife. He
feels mean about abandonin&#39; the peer, but he don&#39;t
seem to have no choice, his wife bein&#39; one of them
women who shares her bad health pretty impartially
round the family. So Billy he departs. But before
he goes he expounds to Joplin Joe, his foreman, the
nature of a peer and how his wants is apt to be
a heap fashionable, and that when he asks for anything
to grasp the can-opener and run to the store-house—Cacta,
you put on the coffee!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That peer arrives in the afternoon, and he never
makes a request any more than a corpse. Beyond
a marked disposition to herd by himself and to
maintain the greatest possible distance between his
own person and a six-shooter, he don&#39;t vary none
from the bulk of tenderfeet. At night, when all
parties retires, and Joplin Joe ponders on them
untouched, effete luxuries in the store-room, and
how the can-opener &#39;ain&#39;t once been dimmed in the
cause of hospitality, it frets him considerable, and he
feels he ain&#39;t doin&#39; his duty to the absent Billy Ames.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span>
<a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"At sunrise he can stand it no longer. He thunders
on the Britisher&#39;s door with the butt of his six-shooter,
calling out:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Peer, peer, be you awake?&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The peer allowed he was, though his teeth was
rattling like broken crockery.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Peer, would you relish some "salmon esplinade"?&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The peer allowed he wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Peer, would you relish some "chicken marine-go"?&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The peer allowed he shore wouldn&#39;t, and the
crockery rattled harder than ever. Joplin Joe then
tried him on the hair-oil and the throat lozengers,
the peer declining each with thanks.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Peer,&#39; said Joplin Joe, fair busting with hospitality,
&#39;is there anything in this Gawd&#39;s world that
you do want?&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The crockery rattled an interlood, then Joplin
Joe made out:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Thanks, very much. I should like a ba-ath&#39;—Clematis,
you see if them biscuits is brownin&#39;.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Joe he ran to the store-room, and his eye encountered
a barrel of corned-beef. He calls to a
couple of cow-punchers, and the first thing you
know that late corned steer is piled onto the prairie
and them cow-punchers is hustling the empty
barrel in to the peer. Next they detaches the steps
from the kitchen door, ropes &#39;em to the barrel and
introduces the peer to his bath. He&#39;s good people
all right, and when he sees they calls his bluff he
steps in all right and lets &#39;em soak him a couple of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span>
<a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
buckets. This here move restores all parties to a
mutual understanding, and the peer he bathes in
the corned-beef barrel regular durin&#39; his stay—you
see the habit had cinched him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Ned had shot an antelope a day or two previous,
and antelope steak, broiled over a glowing bed of
wood coals, with black coffee, stewed dried apples,
and soda biscuit made up what Mary found to be
an unexpectedly palatable breakfast. As camp did
not include a cow, no milk or butter was served
with meals. Nevertheless, the hungry tenderfoot
was quite content, and missed none of the appurtenances
she had been brought up to believe essential
to a civilized meal, not even the little silver jug that
Aunt Martha always insisted came over with William
the Conqueror—Aunt Martha scorned the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">May-flower</span>
contingent as parvenus.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The family sat on the grass, tailor fashion, and
every one helped himself to what appetite prompted,
in a fashion that suggested brilliant gymnastic
powers. To pass a dish to any one, the governess
discovered, was construed as an evidence of mental
weakness and eccentricity. The family satisfied
its appetite without assistance or amenities, but
with the skill of a troupe of jugglers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Breakfast was half over when Mrs. Yellett laid
down her knife, which she had handled throughout
the meal with masterly efficiency. Mary watched
her in hopeless embarrassment, and wondered if
her own timid use of a tin fork could be construed
as an unfriendly comment upon the Yelletts&#39; more
simple and direct code of table etiquette.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span>
<a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Land&#39;s sakes! I just felt, all the time we&#39;ve been
eating, we was forgettin&#39; something. You children
ought to remember, I got so much on my mind."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">All eyes turned anxiously to the cooking-stove,
while an expression of frank regret began to settle
over the different faces. The backbone of their appetites
had been broken, and there was something
else, perhaps something even more appetizing, to
come.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Interpreting the trend of their glance and expression,
up flared Mrs. Yellett, with as great a show
of indignation as if some one had set a match to her
petticoats.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I declare, I never see such children; no more
nacheral feelin&#39;s than a herd of coyotes; never
thinks of a plumb thing but grub. No, make no
mistake about the character of the objec&#39; we&#39;ve forgot.
&#39;Tain&#39;t sweet pertaters, &#39;tain&#39;t molasses, &#39;tain&#39;t
corn-bread—it&#39;s paw! It&#39;s your pore old paw—him
settin&#39; in the tent, forsook and neglected by his own
children."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">All started up to remedy their filial neglect without
loss of time, but Mrs. Yellett waved them back
to their places.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t the whole posse of you go after him, like
he&#39;d done something and was to be apprehended.
Ben, you go after your father."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Ben strode over to the little white tent that
Mary had noticed glimmering in the moonlight
the preceding evening, and presently emerged, supporting
on his arm a partially paralyzed old man,
who might have been Rip Van Winkle in the worst
<span class="tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span>
<a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of tempers. His white hair and beard encircled a
shrivelled, hawklike face, the mouth was sucked
back in a toothless eddy that brought tip of nose
and tip of chin into whispering distance, the eyes
glittered from behind the overhanging, ragged brows
like those of a hungry animal searching through the
brush for its prey.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"If you&#39;ve done eatin&#39;," whispered Mrs. Yellett to
Miss Carmichael, "you&#39;d better run on. Paw&#39;s
langwidge is simply awful when we forget to bring
him to meals." Mary ran on.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When, after the lapse of some thirty minutes or so,
the stentorian voice of Mrs. Yellett recalled Mary to
camp, she found that the tin breakfast service had
been washed and returned to the mess-box, the beds
had been neatly folded and piled in one of the wagons—in
fact, the extremely simple tent-hold, to coin
a word, was in absolute order. It was just 6 A.M.,
and Mrs. Yellett thought it high time to begin school.
Mary tried to convey to her that the hour was somewhat
unusual, but she seemed to think that for pupils
who were beginning their tasks comparatively late in
life it would be impossible to start sufficiently early
in the morning. So at this young and tender hour,
with many misgivings, Mary set about preparing her
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">al fresco</span> class-room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She chose a nice, flat little piece of the United
States, situated in the shade of the clump of willows
that bordered a trickling creek not far from her
sylvan bath-room of the early morning. How she
was to sit on the ground all day and yet preserve a
properly pedagogical demeanor was the first question
<span class="tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span>
<a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to be settled. That there was nothing even remotely
resembling a chair in camp she felt reasonably
assured, as "paw" was sitting on an inverted
soap-box under a pine-tree, and "paw," by reason
of age and infirmity, appropriated all luxuries. Mrs.
Yellett, with her usual acumen, grasped the situation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;m figgerin&#39;," she commented, "that there must
be easier ways of governin&#39; than sittin&#39; up like a
prairie-dog while you&#39;re at it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Yellett took a hurried survey of the camp,
lessening the distance between herself and one of
the light wagons with a gait in which grace was
entirely subservient to speed; then, with one capacious
wrench of the arms, she loosened the spring seat
from the wagon and bore it to the governess with an
artless air of triumph. It was difficult, under these
circumstances, to explain to Mrs. Yellett that without
that symbol of scholastic authority, a desk, the
wagon seat was useless. Nevertheless, Mary set
forth, with all her eloquence, the mission of a desk.
Mrs. Yellett was genuinely depressed. Had she imported
the magician without his wand—Aladdin
without his lamp? She proposed a bewildering
choice—an inverted wash-tub, two buckets sustaining
the relation of caryatides to a board, the sheet-iron
cooking-stove. In an excess of solicitude she
even suggested robbing "paw" of his soap-box.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary chose the wash-tub on condition that Mrs.
Yellett consented to sacrifice the handles in the
cause of lower education. She felt that an inverted
tub that was likely to see-saw during class hours
<span class="tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span>
<a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would tend rather to develop a sense of humor in her
pupils than to contribute to her pedagogical dignity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The camp, as may already have been inferred,
enjoyed a matriarchal form of government. Its
feminine dictator was no exception to the race of
autocrats in that she was not an absolute stranger
to the rosy byways of self-indulgence. There was a
strenuous quality in her pleasuring perhaps not inconsistent
in one whose daily tasks included sheep-herding,
ditch-digging, varied by irrigating and
shearing in their proper seasons. Under the circumstances,
it was not surprising that her wash-tub
bore about the same relationship to her real
duties as does the crochet needle or embroidery
hoop to the lives of less arduously engaged women.
It was at once her fad and her relaxation, the dainty
feminine accomplishment with which she whiled
away the hours after a busy day spent with pick and
shovel. Of all this Mary was ignorant when she proposed
that Mrs. Yellett saw off the tub-handles in
the cause of culture. However, Mrs. Yellett procured
a saw, yet the hand that held it lingered in
its descent on the handles. She contemplated the
tub as affectionately as Hamlet regarding the skull
of "Alas, poor Yorick!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"This," she observed, "is the only thing about
camp that reminds me I&#39;m a woman. I&#39;d plumb
forget it many a time if it warn&#39;t for this little tub.
The identity of a woman is mighty apt to get
mislaid when dooty compels her to assoome the
pants cast aside by the nacheral head of the house
in sickness or death. It&#39;s ben six years now since
<span class="tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span>
<a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
paw&#39;s done a thing but set &#39;round and wait for
meals." Mrs. Yellett sighed laboriously. "Not
that I&#39;m holdin&#39; it agin him none. When a man
sees eighty, it&#39;s time he bedded himself down comfortable
and waited for the nacheral course of events
to weed him out. But when the boys get old
enough to tend to herdin&#39;, irrigatin&#39;, and the work
that God A&#39;mighty provided that man might get the
chance to sweat hisself for bread, accordin&#39; to the
Scriptures, I aim to indulge myself by doin&#39; a wash
of clothes every day, even if I have to take clean
clothes and do &#39;em over again."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The poor "gov&#39;ment&#39;s" tender heart could not
resist this presentation of the case.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"We won&#39;t touch the handles, Mrs. Yellett," she
laughed. "I&#39;m glad you told me you had a personal
sentiment for the tub. There are some things
I should feel the same way about—my hoe and rake,
for instance, that I care for my garden with, at
home. And that suggests to me, why not dig two
little trenches for the handles and plant the tub?
Then I shall have an even firmer foundation on
which to arrange the—the—the educational miscellany."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The suggestion of this harmless expedient was
gratefully received, and the "desk" duly implanted,
whereupon Mary pathetically sought to embellish
her "class-room" from such scanty materials as happened
to be at hand. A hemstitched bureau scarf
that she had tucked in her trunk, in unquestioning
faith in the bureau that was to be part of the
ranch equipment, took the "raw edge," as it were,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span>
<a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
off the desk. A bunch of prairie flowers, flaming
cactus blossoms in scarlet and yellow, ox-eyed
daisies, white clematis from the creek, seemed none
the less decorative for the tin cup that held them.
Mary grimly told herself that her school was to
have refining influences, even if it had no furniture.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The books, pencils, and paper arranged in decorous
little piles, Miss Carmichael announced to her
patroness that school was ready to open. Mrs.
Yellett, who had never heard that "a soft voice is
an excellent thing in woman," and whose chest-notes
were not unlike those of a Durham in sustained
volume of sound, made the valley of the Wind River
echo with the summons of the pupils to school, upon
which the teacher herself was overcome by the absurdity
of the situation and had barely time to escape
back of the willows, where she laughed till she
cried.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As the pupils trooped obediently to school, Mary
noted that they carried no flowers to their dear
teacher, but that Ben, the oldest pupil, twenty-one
years old, six feet four inches in height and deeply
saturnine in manner, carried a six-shooter in his
cartridge-belt. The teacher felt that she was the
last to deny a pupil any reasonable palliative of the
tedium of class-hours—the nearness of her own
school-days inclined her to leniency in this particular—but
she was hardly prepared to condone a six-shooter,
and confided her fears to Mrs. Yellett, who
received them with the indulgent tolerance a strong-minded
woman might extend to the feminine flutter
aroused by a mouse. She explained that Ben did
<span class="tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span>
<a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not shoot for "glory," but to defend the herd from
the casual calls of mountain-lions, bears, and coyotes.
Jack and Ned, who were very nearly as tall as their
older brother, carried similar weapons. Mary prayed
that a fraternal spirit might dwell among her
pupils.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The Misses Yellett were hardly less terrifying than
their brothers. They had their father&#39;s fierce, hawklike
profile, softened by youth, and the appalling
height and robustness due to the freedom and fresh
air of a nomadic existence. Their costumes might,
Mary thought, have been fashioned out of gunny-sacks
by the simple expedient of cutting holes for
the head and arms. The description of the dress
worn by the charcoal-burner&#39;s daughter in any
mediaeval novel of modern construction would approximate
fairly well the school toilets of these
young lady pupils. The boys wore overalls and
flannel shirts, which, in contrast to the sketchy
effects of their sisters&#39; costumes, seemed almost
modish. Mrs. Yellett then left the "class-room,"
saying she must take Ben&#39;s place with the sheep.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The Brobdingnags, huge of stature, sinister of
aspect, deeply distrustful of the rites in which they
were about to participate, closed in about their
teacher. From the pigeon-holes of memory Mary
drew forth the academic smile with which a certain
teacher of hers had invariably opened school. The
pupils greeted the academic smile with obvious
suspicion. No one smiled in camp. When anything
according with their conception of the humorous
happened, they laughed uproariously. Thus,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span>
<a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
early in the morning, on his way to breakfast, Ned
had stumbled over an ax and severely cut his head.
Every one but Ned saw the point of this joke immediately,
and hearty guffaws testified to their
appreciation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Miss Carmichael took her place behind the upturned
tub.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Will you please be seated?" she said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The class complied with the instantaneous precision
of automata newly greased and in excellent
working order. Their abrupt obedience was
disconcerting. Some one must have been drilling
them, thought their anxious teacher, in the art of
simultaneous squatting. The temper of the class
respecting scholastic deportment leaned towards
rigidity bordering on self-torture.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary made out a roll-call, and by unanimous
consent it was agreed to arrange the class as it then
stood, or rather squatted, with the Herculean Ben
at the top, and gradually diminishing in size till it
reached the vanishing point with Cacta, who was
ten and the least terrifying of all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"And now," ventured the teacher, with the
courage of a white rabbit, "what have you been in
the habit of studying?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Absolute silence on the part of the class, which
confronted its questioner straight as a row of
bottles, presenting faces imperturbable as so many
sphinxes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Other questions met with an equally disheartening
response. Miss Carmichael sat up straight, pushed
back the persistent curls from her face, and bent
<span class="tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span>
<a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
every energy towards the achievement of a "firm"
demeanor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Clematis," said she, wisely selecting perhaps the
least formidable of the class, "I want you to give
me some idea of the kind of work you have been
doing, so that we may all be able to understand each
other. Now, in your mathematics, for instance,
which of you have finished with your arithmetic,
and which—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What do you mean?" begged Clematis, somewhat
tearful.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Where are you in your arithmetic?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nowhere, ma&#39;am."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Do you mean you have never learned any?"
Mary Carmichael shuddered as she icily put the
question.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, ma&#39;am."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Is that the case with all of you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Emphatic nods left no room for doubt.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then we&#39;ll leave that for the present. If you
will tell me, Clematis, what kind of work you have
been doing in your history and English, we will get
to work on those to-day. What books have you
been using?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Not unnaturally, Clematis, who was emotional
and easily impressed, began to feel as though she
were a criminal. She sobbed in a helpless, feminine
way. Ben spoke up, fearsomely, from the top of the
class.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"We &#39;ain&#39;t got no books," said he, in grim rebuke,
as though to put an end to a profitless discussion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Do you wish me to understand," quavered Mary,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span>
<a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
"that you have had no studies—that you—can&#39;t
read?—that you—don&#39;t know—anything?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s it," said Ben, with the nearest approach
to cheerfulness he had yet manifested.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Meanwhile there lay on the teacher&#39;s "desk" copies
of Clodd&#39;s <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Childhood of the World</span>, two of that
excellent series of <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">History Primers</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">The Young
Geologist</span>, all carefully selected, in the fulness of
Mary&#39;s ignorance, for the little pupils of her imagination.
She had brought no primer, as Mrs. Yellett&#39;s
letter had distinctly said that the youngest child
was ten and that all were comparatively advanced
in their studies. More than ever Mary longed to
penetrate the mystery of that Irish linen decoy, for
without doubt it was to be her melancholy fate to
conduct this giant band through the alphabet!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Accordingly she wrote out the letters of the alphabet
with large simplicity and a sublime renunciation
of flourish. The class received it tepidly. Mary
grew eloquent over its unswerving verities. The
class remained lukewarm. The difference between
a and b was a matter of indifference to the house of
Yellett. They regarded their teacher&#39;s strenuous efforts
to furnish a key to the acquirement of the alphabet
with the amused superiority of "grown-ups"
watching infant antics with pencil and paper. Meanwhile
her fear of the class increased in proportion as
her ability to hold its attention diminished. The
backbone of the school was plainly wilting. The little
scholars, armed to the teeth, no longer sat up
straight as tenpins. After twenty-five minutes of
educational experience, satiety bowled them over.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span>
<a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">A single glance had convinced Ben that the alphabet
was beneath contempt. He yawned automatically
at regular intervals—long, dismal yawns
that threatened to terminate in a howl, the unchecked,
primitive type of yawn that one hears in
the cages of the zoological gardens on a dull day.
Miss Carmichael raised interrogatory eyebrows, but
she might as well have looked reproof at a Bengal
tiger.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The class was rapidly promoted to c-a-t, cat; but
these dizzy intellectual heights left them cold and
dull. Ben began to clean his revolver, and on being
asked why he did not pay attention to his lessons,
answered, briefly:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It&#39;s all d——d foolishness."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Cacta and Clem were pulling each other&#39;s hair.
Mary affected not to see this sisterly exchange of
torture. Ned whittled a stick; and, in chorus, when
their teacher told them that d-o-g spelled dog, they
shouted derision, and affirmed that they had no
difficulty in compelling the obedience of Stump even
without this particular bit of erudition. Though
Mary had always abhorred corporal punishment, she
began to see arguments in its favor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">With the handleless tub as an elbow-rest the teacher
took counsel with herself. Strategy must be employed
with the intellectual conquest of the Brobdingnags.
Summoning all the pedagogical dignity
of which she was capable, she asked:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Boys, don&#39;t you want to know how to read?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Noap," responded the head of the class.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t you want to know how to write?"</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span>
<a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Noap."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But, my dear boy, what would you do if you
left here and went out into the world, where every
one knows these things and your ignorance would
be evident at every turn. What would you do?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Slug the whole blamed outfit!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary looked at her watch. School had lasted just
forty-five minutes. Had time become petrified?</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span>

<a name="toc_15" id="toc_15"></a>
<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">Judith Adjusts The Situation</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary had been a member of the Yellett household
for something over a week, and the intellectual
conquest of her Brobdingnag pupils seemed
as hopeless as on that first day. School seemed
to be regarded by them as a sort of neutral territory,
admirably adapted for the settlement of long-standing
grudges, the pleasant exchange of practical jokes,
peace and war conferences; also as a mart of trade,
where fire-arms, knives, bear and elk teeth might
be swapped with a greater expenditure of time and
conversation than under the maternal eye. "Teacher,"
as she was understood and accepted by the
house of Yellett, undoubtedly filled a long-felt want.
Presiding over a school of six-imp power for a week,
however, had humbled Mary to the point of seriously
considering a letter to the home government,
meekly asking for return transportation. But this
was before feminine wile had struggled with feminine
vanity, and feminine wile won the day.
School still continued to open at six, from which
early and unusual hour it continued, without recess
or interruption, till noon, when dinner pleasantly
<span class="tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span>
<a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
invaded the scholastic monotony, to the infinite
relief of all parties concerned.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary had dismissed her pupils a few minutes
before the usual hour, on a particularly bad day,
that she might rally her scattered faculties and
present something of a countenance to the watchful
eye of Mrs. Yellett. Every element of humor had
vanished from the situation. The inverted tub was
no longer a theme for merriment in her diary; home-life
without a house was no longer a diverting
epigram; she had closed her eyes that she might
not see the mountains in all their grandeur. In her
present mood of abject homesickness the white-capped
peaks were part and parcel of the affront.
With head sunk in the palms of her hands, and
elbows resting on the inverted tub, Mary presented
a picture of woe, in which the wicked element of
comedy was not wholly lacking. Looking up suddenly,
she saw Judith Rodney advancing. The
first glimpse of her put Mary in a more rational
mood.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;m so glad to see you! Behold my class-room
appointments! They may seem a trifle novel,
but, for that matter, so are my pupils," began Mary,
determining to present the same front to Judith
that she had to Mrs. Yellett. But Judith was not
to be put off. She looked into Mary&#39;s eyes and
did not relax her gaze until she was rewarded with
an answering twinkle. Then Mary laughed long
and merrily, the first good, hearty laugh since the
beginning of her teaching.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Tell me," Mary broke out, suddenly, "or the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span>
<a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
suspense will kill me, who wrote that lovely letter—on
such good quality Irish linen, too? Snob that
I was, it was the letter that did it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"So you have your suspicions that it was not a
home product?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You didn&#39;t do it, did you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh no; though I was asked, and so was Miss
Wetmore, I believe. Of course poor Mrs. Yellett
had no other recourse, as I suppose you know. I
chose to be disobliging that time, and was sorry
for it afterwards—sorry when I heard about the
letter that really went! Do you find the sheep-wagon
so very dreadful?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I thought," laughed Mary, "that it was going
to be like a picture I saw in a magazine, Mexican
hammocks, grass cushions, and a lady pouring tea
from a samovar; instead it was the sheep-wagon
and &#39;Do you sleep light or dark?&#39; There is Mrs.
Yellett calling us to dinner. Shall I have a chance
to talk to you alone afterwards?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;ve come all the way from Dax&#39;s to see you,"
explained Judith, with characteristic directness.
"We have all the afternoon."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Really!" Mary displayed a flash of school-girl
enthusiasm. "I feel as if I could almost bear the
scenery."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Presumably Judith was a favorite guest of the
Yellett household, and not without reason. She
took her place in the circle about the homely,
steaming fare, with an ease and grace that suggested
that dining off the ground was an every-day
affair with her, and chairs and tables undreamed-of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span>
<a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
luxuries. Mary envied her ready tact. Why
could she not meet these people with Judith&#39;s
poise—bring out the best of them, as she did?
The boys talked readily and naturally—there was
even a flavor to what they said. As for herself,
try never so conscientiously and she would be
confronted by frank amusement or shy distrust.
Even "paw" beamed at Judith appreciatively as
he consumed his meal with infinite, toothless labor.
The Spartan family became almost sprightly
under the pleasantly stimulating influence of its
guest.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What kind of basques are they wearing this
summer, Judy?" inquired Mrs. Yellett, regarding
her guest&#39;s trim shirt-waist judicially. "I reckon
them loose, meal-sack things must be all the go
since you and Miss Mary both have &#39;em; but give
me a good, tight-fittin&#39; basque, every time. How&#39;s
any one to know whether you got a figure or not,
in a thing that never hits you anywhere?" questioned
the matriarch, not without a touch of pride
anent her own fine proportions.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You really ought to have a shirt-waist, Mrs.
Yellett. You&#39;ve no idea of the comfort of them,
till you&#39;ve worn them."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I don&#39;t see but I&#39;ll have to come to it." Her
tone was frankly regretful, as one who feels obliged
to follow the behests of fashion, yet, in so doing,
sacrifices a cherished ideal. Mary Carmichael choked
over her coffee in an abortive attempt to restrain
her audible hilarity. Judith, without a trace of
amusement, was discussing materials, cut, and
<span class="tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span>
<a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
buttons; the plainswoman had proved herself the
better gentlewoman of the two.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Get me a spotty calico, white, with a red dot,
will you, the next time you&#39;re over to Ervay?
Buttons accordin&#39; to your judgment; but if you
could get some white chiny with a red ring, I think
they&#39;d match it handsome." She frowned reflectively.
"You&#39;re sure one of them loose, hangy
things &#39;d become me? Then you can bring it over
Tuesday, when you come to the hunt."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What hunt?" asked Judith, in all simplicity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why, the wolf-hunt. Peter Hamilton come
here three days ago and made arrangements for &#39;em
all to have supper here after it was done. &#39;Lowed
there was a young Eastern lady in the party, Miss
Colebrooke, who couldn&#39;t wait to meet me. Course
you&#39;re goin&#39;, Judy? You&#39;ve plumb forgot it, or
somethin&#39; happened to the messenger. Who ever
hyeard tell of anythin&#39; happenin&#39; in this yere county
&#39;thout you bein&#39; the very axle of it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith had not betrayed her chagrin by the least
change of countenance. To the most searching
glance every faculty was intent on the shirt-waist
with the ringed buttons. Yet both women felt—by
a species of telepathy wholly feminine—that
Judith was deeply wounded. Loyal Sarah Yellett
decided that Hamilton&#39;s guests would get but a
scant supper from her if her friend Judith was to be
unfavored with an invitation, while Judith, in her
own warm heart, resented as deeply as Peter&#39;s
slight of herself, his tale of Miss Colebrooke&#39;s impatience
to meet Mrs. Yellett. The matriarch&#39;s
<span class="tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span>
<a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dominant personality evoked many a smile even
from those most deeply conscious of her worth;
but it wasn&#39;t like Peter to make a spectacle of his
ruggedly honest neighbor. Nevertheless she remarked,
coolly:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I sha&#39;n&#39;t be able to bring your shirt-waist things
up Tuesday, I&#39;m afraid, Mrs. Yellett, but I&#39;ll try to
bring them towards the end of the week." Then,
with a swift change of subject, "How are the
boys getting on with their education, Miss Carmichael?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The boys looked at Mary out of the corners of
their eyes. Their prowess in the field of letters
had not been publicly discussed before. Mary
Carmichael, emboldened by Judith&#39;s presence, looked
at her tormentors with a judicious glance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The girls are doing fairly well," she replied,
suppressing the mischief in her eyes, "but the boys,
poor fellows, I think something must be the matter
with them. Did they ever fall on their heads when
they were babies, Mrs. Yellett?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Not more than common. All babies fall on
their heads; it&#39;s as common as colic."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Poor boys!" said Mary, with a manner that suggested
they were miles away, rather than within a
few feet of her. "Poor boys! I&#39;ve never seen anything
like it. They try so hard, too, yet they can
make nothing of work that would be play for a
child of three. They must have fallen on their
heads harder than you supposed, Mrs. Yellett."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Perhaps their skulls were a heap frailer than I
allowed for at the time," said Mrs. Yellett, with
<span class="tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span>
<a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
similar remoteness, yet with a twinkle that showed
Mary she understood the situation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"An infant&#39;s skull doesn&#39;t stand much knocking
about, I suppose, Mrs. Yellett?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Not a great deal, if there ain&#39;t plenty of vinegar
and brown paper handy, and I seldom had such
fancy fixings in camp. It&#39;s too bad my boys should
be dumb &#39;n account of a little thing like vinegar and
brown paper."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Maw, they be dumb as Injuns," declared Cacta,
preening herself, while the Messrs. Yellett reapplied
themselves to their dinner with ostentatious interest.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, well!" said Mrs. Yellett; "it be a hard
blow to me to know that my sons are lackings;
there&#39;s mothers I know as would give vent to their
disapp&#39;inted ambition in ways I&#39;d consider crool to
the absent-minded. Now hearken, the whole outfit
of you! Any offspring of mine now present and
forever after holding his peace, who proves feebleminded
by the end of the coming week, takes over
all the work, labor, and chores of such offspring as
demonstrates himself in full possession of his
faculties, the matter to be reported on by the
gov&#39;ment."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">No sovereign, issuing a proclamation of war,
could have assumed a more formidable mien than
Mrs. Yellett, squatting erect on the prairie, crowned
by her rabbit-skin cap. Mary and Judith, with
bland, impassive expressions, noted the effect of the
mandate. There was not the faintest symptom of
rebellion; each Brobdingnag accepted the matriarch&#39;s
edict without a murmur.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span>
<a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">With an air of further meditation on the efficacy
of brown paper and vinegar at the crucial moment,
Mrs. Yellett suddenly observed:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The lacking, like the dog, may be taught to
fetch and carry a book; but to learn it he is unable."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Maw, does it say that in the Book of Hiram?"
asked Clematis.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It says that, an&#39; more, too. It says, &#39;The words
of the wise are an expense, but the lovin&#39; parent
don&#39;t grudge &#39;em.&#39;"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary Carmichael had noticed, as her alien presence
came to be less of a check on Mrs. Yellett&#39;s
natural medium of expression, that she was much
addicted to a species of quotation with which she
impartially adorned her conversation, pointed family
morals, or administered an occasional reproof. These
family aphorisms were sometimes semi-legal, sometimes
semi-scriptural in turn of phrase, and built
on a foundation of homely philosophy. They were
ascribed to the "Book of Hiram" and never failed
of salutary effect in the family circle. But the apt
quotations that she had just heard piqued Mary&#39;s
curiosity more than before.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Do you happen to have a copy of the Book
of Hiram, Mrs. Yellett?" she asked, in all innocence,
supposing that the &#39;homely apothegms were to be
found at the back of some patent-medicine almanac.
Judith Rodney listened in wonder. The question
had never before been asked in her hearing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I lost mine." Mrs. Yellett folded her arms and
looked at her questioner with something of a
challenging mien.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span>
<a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What a pity! I&#39;ve been so interested in the
quotations I&#39;ve heard you make from it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What&#39;s the matter with &#39;em?" she demanded,
pride and apprehension equally commingled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith Rodney rushed to the rescue:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nothing is the matter with them, Mrs. Yellett,"
she said, with her disarming smile, "except that
there is not quite enough to go around."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The matriarch had the air of gathering herself together
for something really worth while. Then she
tossed off:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;&#39;Tain&#39;t always the quality of the grub that
confers the flavor, but sometimes the scarcity
thereof.&#39;"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Perhaps it has been the good-fortune of some of
us to say a word of praise to an author, while unconscious
of his relationship to the book praised.
Mark the genial glow radiating from every feature
of our auditor! How we feel ourselves anointed
with his approval, our good taste and critical faculty
how commended! It is a luxury that goes a long
way towards mitigating the discomfitures caused by
the reverse of this unctuous blunder.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The Book of Hiram," said Mrs. Yellett, angling
for time, "is a book—it do surprise me that it escapes
your notice back East. You ever heard tell
of the Book of Mormon?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary assented.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, the Book of Hiram is like the Book of
Mormon, only a heap more undefiled. The youngest
child can read it without asking a single embarrassing
question of its elder, and the oldest sinner
<span class="tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span>
<a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
can read it without having any fleshly meditations
intrudin&#39; on his piety."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The Yellett family had by this time dispersed
itself for the afternoon, and the matriarch and the
two girls started in to clear away the meal and wash
the dishes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s the kind of book for me," continued
Mrs. Yellett, vigorously swishing about in the soapy
water. "Story-books don&#39;t count none with me
these days. It&#39;s my opinion that things are snarled
up a whole lot too much in real life without pestering
over the anguish of print folks. Flesh and blood suffering
goes without a groan of sympathy from the
on-lookers, while novel characters wade to the neck
in compassion. I&#39;ve pondered on that a whole lot,
seem&#39; a heap of indifference to every-day calamity,
and the way I assay it is like this: print folks has
terrible fanciful layouts given to their griefs and
worriments by the authors of their being. The trimmings
to their troubles is mighty attractive. Don&#39;t
you reckon I&#39;d be willin&#39; to have a spell of trouble
if I had a sweeping black velvet dress to do it in?
Yes, indeed, I&#39;d be willin&#39; to turn a few of them
shades of anguish, &#39;gray&#39;s ashes,&#39; &#39;pale as death,&#39;
and so on, if they&#39;d give me the dress novel ladies
seems to have for them special occasions."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But you used to like novels, you know you did,
Mrs. Yellett," observed Judith Rodney.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, I didn&#39;t always entertain these views concernin&#39;
romance. You wouldn&#39;t believe it, but there
was a time when I just nacherally went careerin&#39;
round enveloped in fantasies. I was young then—just
<span class="tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span>
<a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
about the time I married paw. Every novel
that was read to me, I mean that I read"—Mrs.
Yellett blushed a deep copper color through her
many coats of tan—"convinced me that I was the
heroine thereof. And, nacherally, I turned over to
paw the feachers and characteristics of the hero in
said book I happened to be enjoyin&#39; at the time.
Paw never knew it, but sometimes he was a dook,
and it was plumb hard work. Just about as hard
as ropin&#39; a mountain-lion an&#39; sayin&#39;, &#39;remember,
you are a sheep from this time henceforth, and
trim your action accordin&#39;.&#39; I&#39;d say to paw, &#39;Let&#39;s
walk together in the gloaming, here in this deserted
garden&#39;; and paw would say, &#39;Name o&#39; Gawd,
woman, have you lost your mind? It&#39;s plumb three
hundred and fifty miles to the Tivoli beer-garden in
Cheyenne, and it ain&#39;t deserted, either!&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then I&#39;d wring my hands in anguish, same as
the Lady Mary, an&#39; paw would declare I was locoed.
He seemed a heap more nacheral when I pretended
he was &#39;Black Ranger, the Pirate King.&#39; His language
came in handy, and his cartridge-belt and
pistol all came in Black Ranger&#39;s outfit. Yes, it
was a heap easier playing he was a pirate than a
dook. All this happened back to Salt Lake, where
me an&#39; paw was married."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Yellett looked towards the mountain-range
that separated her from the Mormon country, and
her listeners realized that she was verging perilously
close to confidences. Mary Carmichael, who dreaded
missing any detail of the chronicle that dealt with
paw in the rôle of apocryphal duke, hastened to say:</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span>
<a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"And you lost your taste for romance, finally?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"In Salt Lake I was left to myself a whole lot-there
was reasons why I didn&#39;t mingle with the Mormon
herd. Paw was mighty attentive to me, but
them was troublous times for paw. I pastures myself
with the fleetin&#39; figures of romance the endoorin&#39;
time and enjoys myself a heap. When paw wasn&#39;t
a dook or a pirate king, unbeknownst to himself, like
as not he was Sir Marmaduke Trevelyun, or somebody
entitled to the same amount of dog.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Bout this time a little stranger was due in our
midst, and the woman who came to take care of me
was plumb locoed over novels, same as me, only
worse. She just hungered for &#39;em, same as if she
had a longin&#39; for something out of season. She
brought a batch of them with her in her trunk, we
borrowed her a lot more, some I don&#39;t know how
she come by. But they didn&#39;t have no effect; it
was like feedin&#39; an&#39; Injun—you couldn&#39;t strike
bottom. She read out of &#39;em to me with disastrous
results happenin&#39;, an&#39; that cured me. The brand
on this here book that effected my change of heart
was <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">The Bride of the Tomb</span>. I forget the name of
the girl in that romance, but she was in hard luck
from the start. She couldn&#39;t head off the man
pursooin&#39; her, any way she turned. She&#39;d wheel
out of his way cl&#39;ar across country, but he&#39;d land
thar fust an&#39; wait for her, a smile on his satanine
feachers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I got so wrought up along o&#39; that book, an&#39; worried
as to the outcome, &#39;most as bad as the girl. Think
of it! An&#39; me with only three baby-shirts an&#39; a flannel
<span class="tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span>
<a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
petticoat made at the time! Seemed &#39;s if I couldn&#39;t
hustle my meals fast enough, I just hankered so
to know what was goin&#39; to happen next! I plumb
detested the man with the handsome feachers, same
as the girl. Me an&#39; her felt precisely alike about
him. And when he shut her up in the family vault
I just giv&#39; up an&#39; was took then an&#39; there, an&#39; me
without so much as finishin&#39; the flannel petticoat!
I never could endure the sight of a novel since.
Perhaps that&#39;s why Ben is so dumb about his books—just
holds a nacheral grudge against &#39;em along of
my havin&#39; to borrow slips for him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Has the Book of Hiram anything to say against
the habit of novel reading, Mrs. Yellett?" inquired
Judith, demurely.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She paused for a moment. "It&#39;s mighty inconvenient
that I should have mislaid that book,
but rounding up my recollections of it, I recall
something like this: &#39;Romance is the loco-weed
of humanity.&#39;"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"So you don&#39;t approve of the Mormon Bible?"
ventured Mary.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I jest nacherally execrates Mormonism, spoken,
printed, or in action," she said, with an emphasis
that suggested the subject had a strong personal
bearing. "I recall a text from the Book of Hiram
touching on Mormon deportment in particklar an&#39;
human nature at large. It says, &#39;Where several
women and one man are gathered together for the
purpose of serving the Lord, the man gets the bulk
of the service."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She broke off suddenly, as if she feared she had
<span class="tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span>
<a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
said too much. "Judy," she demanded, "is Mis&#39;
Dax busy with Leander now?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Not more than usual," smiled Judith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Jest tell her for me, will you, that I want to hire
her husband to do some herdin&#39;; Leander&#39;s handy,
&#39;n&#39; can work good an&#39; sharp, if he is an infidel. An&#39;
I like to have him over now an&#39; then, as you know,
Judy. As the Book of Hiram says, &#39;It&#39;s neighborly
to ease the check-rein of a gentled husband.&#39; But
you tell him I don&#39;t want to hear any of his ever-lastin&#39;
fool argufyin&#39; &#39;bout religion. Leander &#39;d stop
in the middle of shearin&#39; a sheep to argue that
Jonah never came out o&#39; the whale&#39;s belly. I ain&#39;t
no use for infidels, &#39;less they&#39;re muzzled, which
Leander mos&#39; generally is."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">With the feeling that there was an excellent
though unspoken understanding between them, the
two girls walked together to the top of the path
that wandered away from camp towards a bluff
overlooking wave after wave of foot-hills, lying blue
and still like a petrified sea.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;m still dying to know who wrote that letter,"
begged Mary.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It was written by a lady who is very anxious to
return to Washington, and she took that means of
getting one more vote. Her husband is going to run
for the Senate next term. We hear a good deal of
that side of politics, you know."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It was certainly convincing," remarked the
victim of the letter. "My aunts detected many
virtues in the handwriting."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But now that you are really here, isn&#39;t it splendid?
<span class="tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span>
<a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Mountains are such good neighbors. They
give you their great company and yet leave you
your own little reservations."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But I fear I can never feel at home out-of-doors,"
Mary announced, with such a rueful expression that
they both smiled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Perhaps, then, it depends on the frame of mind.
I&#39;ve had longer than you to cultivate it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mary looked towards the mountains, serene in
their strength. "Awesome as they are," she laughed,
"they don&#39;t frighten me nearly as much as Ben
and Ned. They are really very difficile, my pupils,
and I feel so ridiculous sitting up back of that tub,
teaching them letters and the spelling of foolish
words, when they know things I&#39;ve never dreamed
of. The other day, out of a few scratches in the
dust that I should never have given a second glance,
one of them made out that some one&#39;s horses had
broken the corral and one was trailing a rope.
Whereupon my pupil got on a horse, went in search
of the strays, and returned them to men going to a
round-up. After that, the spelling of cat didn&#39;t
seem quite so much of an achievement as it had
before."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But they need the spelling of cat so much more
than you need to understand trail-marks. Why
don&#39;t you try a little strategy with them? Perhaps
a bribe, even? It seems to me I remember something
in history about the part played in colonization
by the bright-colored bead."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Sundry wood-cuts from a long-forgotten primer
history of the United States came back to Mary.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span>
<a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
In that tear-stained, dog-eared volume, all explorers,
from Columbus down to Lewis and Clarke, were
unfailingly depicted in the attitude of salesmen displaying
squares of cloth to savages apparently in
urgent need of them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How stupid of me not to remember Father
Marquette concluding negotiations with a necklace!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Frankly plagiarize the terms of your treaty
from Père Marquette, and there you are!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You are so splendid!" said Mary, impulsively,
remembering Judith&#39;s own sorrows and the smiling
fortitude with which she kept them hidden. "You
make me feel like a horrid little girl that has been
whining."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith looked towards the mountains a long time
without speaking.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"When you know them well, they whisper great
things that little folk can&#39;t take away."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She turned back towards camp, walking lightly,
with head thrown back. Mary watched her. Yes,
the mountains might have admitted her to their
company.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">The Wolf-hunt</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith awakened with all the starry infinitude
of sky for a canopy. In the distance loomed the
foot-hills, watchful sentinels of her slumbers; and,
sloping gently away from them, rolled the plain, like
some smooth, dark sea flowing deep and silently.
Judith, a solitary figure adrift in that still ocean of
space, sat up and watched the stars fade and saw
the young day peer timorously at the world that lay
before it. Her mind, refreshed by long hours of
dreamless sleep, turned to the problem of impending
things, serenely contemplative. The passing of
many mornings and many peoples had the mountains
seen as the wreathed mists came and went
about their brows, and to all who knew the value of
the gift they gave their great company, and to such
as could hear, they told their great secrets. Judith&#39;s
prayer was an outflowing of soul to the great forces
about her, a wish to be in harmony with them, to
remember her kinship, to keep some measure of
their serenity in the press of burdens. The way
of the Indian was ever her way when circumstance
raised no barriers; the four walls of a house were
a prison to her after the days lengthened and the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span>
<a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
summer nights grew warm. To the infinite disapproval
of that custodian of propriety, Mrs. Dax, she
would make her bed beneath the stars, night after
night, and bathe in the cold, clear waters of the
stream that purled from the white-capped crest of
the mountains.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Nasty Injun ways!" scoffed Leander&#39;s masterful
lady, consciously superior from the intrenchment
of her stuffy bedroom, that boasted crochet-work
on the backs of the chairs and a scant lace
curtain at its solitary window.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith, going to her favorite pool to bathe, saw
that it had shrunk till it seemed but a fairy well hid
among the willows. A quarter of a mile above was
another pool, hidden like a jewel in its case of green,
broidered with scarlet roseberries and white clematis;
and towards this she bent her steps, as time was
a-plenty that morning. She kept to the stones of the
creek for a pathway, jumping lightly from those
that were moss-grown to those that hid their nakedness
in the dark, velvet shadows of early morning,
her white feet touching the shallow stream like pale
gulls that dipped and skimmed. "Diana&#39;s Pool,"
as she called it, was always clear. It lay half hid
beneath a shelving rock, a fount for the tiny, white
fall that crooned and sang as it fell. And here
she bathed, as the east flamed where the mountains
blackened against it. Gold halos tipped the clouds,
that melted presently into fiery waves, then burst
into one great aureole through which the sun rode
triumphant, and it was day.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She had kept post-office the day before, and it
<span class="tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span>
<a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would not be till day after to-morrow that the
squires of the lariat would come again to offer their
hearts, their worldly goods, their complete reformation,
if she would only change her mind. It was all
such an old story that she had grown to regard
them with a tenderness almost maternal. But to-day
was all her own, and the spirit of adventure
swelled high in her bosom as she thought of what
she had planned. It was warm and close and still
in the Dax house as Judith made her way softly to
her own room and began her preparations for the
long journey she was to take afoot. To walk in
the abominations devised by the white man for
the purpose of cramping his feet would have been
a serious handicap to Judith. The twenty miles
that she would walk before nightfall was no very
great undertaking to her, but it was part of her
primitive directness to accomplish it with as little expenditure
of fatigue and comfort as possible. Moreover,
who could steal through the forest in those
heeled things without announcing his coming and
frightening the forest folk, and sending them skurrying?
And Judith loved to surprise them and
see them busy with their affairs—to creep along
in her soft, elk-hide moccasins and catch their
watchful eyes and see the things that were not for
the heavy-booted white man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She might have inspired Kitty Colebrooke to a
sonnet as she stepped out into the glad morning
light, in short skirt and jacket, green-clad as the
pines that girdled the mountains, with a knapsack
with rations of bread and meat and the wherewithal
<span class="tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span>
<a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to build a fire should she wander belated. She
softly closed the door, not to awaken Leander and
his slumbering lady, and broke into the running gait
that the Indians use on their all-day journeys, the
elk-hide moccasins falling soft as snow-flakes on the
trail. Dolly she missed chiefly for her companionship,
for Judith had not the white man&#39;s utter helplessness
without a horse in this country of high
altitudes. When she walked she breathed, carried
herself, covered ground like her mother&#39;s people,
and loved the inspiration of it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The eerie shadows of the desert drew back and
hid themselves in the mountains. The day began
with splendid promise—the day of the wolf-hunt,
of which no word had been spoken to her by Peter.
She, too, was going hunting, but silently and unbidden
she would steal through the forest and see
this mysterious woman who played fast and loose
with Peter, who loved her apparently all the better
for the game she played. What manner of woman
could do these things? What manner of woman could
be indifferent to Peter? Judith was consumingly
curious to see. And, apart from this naked and
unashamed curiosity, there was the possibility that
at sight of Miss Colebrooke there might come a
relaxation of Peter&#39;s tyrannous hold upon her
thoughts, her life, her very heart&#39;s blood. Would
her loyalty bear the test of seeing Peter made a fool
of by a woman she could dismiss with a shrug—a
softly speaking shrew, perhaps, who played a waiting
game with her finger on the pulse of Peter&#39;s
prospects? For there was talk of a partnership
<span class="tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span>
<a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with the Wetmores. Or a fool, perhaps, for all her
sonneting, for there are men who relish a weak
headpiece as the chiefest ornament of women,
especially when its indeterminate vagaries boast an
escape-valve remotely connected with the fine arts.
Or a devil-woman, perhaps—an upright wanton who
could think no wrong from very poverty of temperament,
yet kept him dangling. The possibility
of Kitty&#39;s honesty, Judith in her jealousy would
not admit. Had she gone to the devil for him,
stood and faced the drift of opinion for his sake, that
Judith could have understood. But what was the
spinning of verses to a woman&#39;s portion of loving
and being loved? Even Alida, through all her distracting
anxieties, had in her heart the thrice-blessed
leaven, reasoned the woman of the plains, who
might, according to modern standards, be reckoned
a trifle primitive in her psychological deductions.
And, withal, Judith was forced to admit that there
was something simple and true about a man who
would let a woman make a fool of him, whoever
the woman was.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Perhaps with this hunting would end the long
reign of Peter as a divinity. Judith was tired, not
in her vigorous young body, because that was strong
and healthful as the hill wind, but tired in heart and
mind and life. Her destiny had not been beautiful
or happy before he invaded it, but it had been calm,
and now serenity seemed the worthiest gift of the
gods. It was not that she loved him less, but that
she had so long reflected upon him that her imagination
was numb; her thoughts, arid, unfruitful
<span class="tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span>
<a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as the desert, turned from him to the problems that
beset her, and from them back to him again, in dull,
subconscious yearning. She could no longer project
an anguished consciousness to those scenes wherein
he walked and talked with Kitty. Her Indian
fatalism had intervened. "Life was life," to be
lived or left. And yet she felt herself a poor creature,
one who had lived long on illusion, who had
bent her neck to the yoke of arid unrealities. The
pale-haired woman who kept him with her miserliness
of self, who intruded no sombre tragedy
of loving, was well worth a trip across the foot-hills
to see. And yet, Judith reflected, it was the portion
of her mother&#39;s daughter to make of loving
the whole business of life, even if she rebelled and
fought against it as an accursed destiny. It was in
her inheritance to know and live for the wild thrill
of ecstasy in her pulses, to feel trembling joy and
despair and frantic hope, that exacted its tribute
hardly less poignant; as it was, also, to feel a shivering
sensitiveness in regard to the loneliness and
bitterness of her life, to have the same measureless
capacity for sorrow that she had for loving, to
have a soul attuned to the tragedy of things, to love
the mighty forces about her, to feel the reflection
of all their moods in her heart, and, lastly, it was her
destiny to be the daughter of a half-Sioux and a border
adventurer, and to feel the counter influences
of the two races make forever of her heart a battleground.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Her light feet scarcely touched the ground as she
sped swiftly through all the network of the hills;
<span class="tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span>
<a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and more than once her woman&#39;s heart asked the
question, "And, prithee, Judith, if from henceforth
you are only to hold fellowship with the stars and
have no part in the ways of men, why do you walk
a day&#39;s journey to catch a glimpse of a pale-haired
woman?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She knew the probable course of the wolf-hunt.
She had been on scores of them, galloped with Peter
after the fleeing gray thing that swept along the
ground like the nucleus of a whirling dust-devil.
At least she was sure of the place of their nooning—a
limpid stream that ran close to many young
pine-trees. Here was a pause in the rugged ascent,
a level space of open green, thick with buffalo grass.
Many times had she been here with Peter, sometimes
with many other people on the chase—sometimes,
and these occasions were enshrined in her
memory, each with its own particular halo, with
Peter alone; and they had fished for trout and
cooked their supper on the grassy levels. It was
in Judith&#39;s planning to arrive before the hunting-party,
to hide among the thickets of scrub pine
that grew along the steep cliffs and overlooked the
grassy level, to take her fill of looking at the pale-haired
girl and the hunters at their merrymaking,
and, when she had seen, to steal back across the
trail to the Daxes&#39;. They would not penetrate the
thickets where she meant to hide, and, should they,
she was prepared for that contingency, too. She
had brought with her a bright-colored shawl that
she would throw over her head, and with the start
of them she could outrun them all, even Peter.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span>
<a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Had she not outdistanced him easily, many times,
in fun? Through the tangle of tree-trunks that
grew not far from the thicket, they would think she
was but a poor Shoshone squaw lying in wait for
the broken meat of the revellers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">By crossing and recrossing the tiny creeks that
trickled slow and obstructed through the gaunt
levels of plain and foot-hill, she had come by a
direct route to the fringes of the pine country. And
here she found a world dim, green, and mysterious.
It was wellnigh inconceivable that the land of sage-brush
and silence could, within walking distance of
desolation, show such wealth of young timber, such
shade and beauty. Her noiseless footfalls scarce
startled a sage-hen that, realizing too late her presence,
froze to the dead stump—a ruffled gray excrescence
with glittering bead eyes that stared at
her furtively, the one live thing in the tense body.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The sun wanted an hour of noon when Judith
rested by the stream, bathed her face and hands,
flushed from the long walk, ate the bread and meat,
then lay on the bed of pine-needles, brown and soft
from the weathering of many suns and snows. She
had been all day in the company she loved best—the
earth, the sky, the sun and wind—and in her
heart at last was a deep tranquillity. Thus she
could face life and ask nothing but to watch the
cloud fleeces as they are spun and heaped high in
the long days of summer; in soberer moods to watch
the thoughts of the Great Mystery as He reveals them
in the shifting cloud shapes; to penetrate further
and further into the councils of the great forces.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span>
<a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Thus did she dream the moments away till the sun
was high in the blue and threw long, yellow splashes
of light on her still body, on the soft pine-needles,
beneath the boughs. But there was no time for
further day-dreams if she intended to forestall the
hunters at the place of nooning. She followed a
game trail that lay along the stream, ascending
through the dense growths till she reached the top
of the jutting rocks. Her hair was loosened, her
skirt awry, and the pine-needles stood out from it
as from a cushion. Much of the way she gained by
creeping beneath the low branches on her hands and
knees. No white woman would be likely to follow
her reasoned the daughter of the plains. It would
be a little too hard on her appearance. And here,
by lying flat and hanging over the jutting knob of
rock, with a pine branch in her hand, she could see
this mysterious woman and Peter and the hunters.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She broke a branch to shade her face, she looked
down on the grassy level. She waited, but there
was no sound of hoofs falling muffled on the soft
ground. The shadows of the pines contended with
the splashes of sunlight for the little world beneath
the trees. They trembled in mimic battle, then the
shadows stole the sunlight, bit by bit, till all was
pale-green twilight, and there was no sound of the
hunters.</p>

<br />

<p class="tei tei-p">The hunters, meanwhile, had not been altogether
successful in the chase. The necessary wolf had
been coy, and they, perforce, had to compromise
with his poor relation, the coyote—a poor relation,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span>
<a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
indeed, whose shabby coat, thinned by the process
of summer shedding, made it an unworthy souvenir
to Miss Colebrooke. But it was not the lack of a
wolf that robbed the hunting-party of its zest for
Kitty. She could not tell what it was, but something
seemed to have gone wrong with the day from
the beginning. She rode beside her cavalier in a
habit the like of which the country had never before
seen, and Peter, usually the most observant of men,
had no word for its multitude of perfections. In the
first realization of disappointment with the day, the
hunt, the hardships of the long ride, her perturbed
consciousness took up the problem of this missing
element and tried to adjust itself to the irritating
absence. Kitty wondered if it were something she
had forgotten. No, there were her two little cambric
pocket-handkerchiefs, remotely suggestive of orris,
and bearing her monogram delicately wrought and
characteristic. It was not her watch, the ribbon
fob of which fluttered now and then in the breeze.
It was not veil nor scarf-pin nor any of the paraphernalia
of the properly garbed horsewoman. And yet
there was something missing, something she should
have had with her, something the absence of which
was taking the savor from the day&#39;s hunting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It must be the very bigness of this great, splendid
world that gave her the sense of being alone at sea.
Intuitively she turned and looked at Peter riding
beside her. There was something in his face that
made her look again before accepting the realization
at first incredulously, then with frank amusement.
Peter had scarcely spoken since they left the ranch.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span>
<a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
She had come down to breakfast so sure of her new
riding-habit. The Wetmore girls had been moved
to hyperboles about its cut and fit and the trim
shortness of the skirt—short riding-skirts were something
of a novelty then. The fine gold hair, twisted
tight at the back of the shapely head, was like a
coiled mass of burnished metal, some safe-keeping
device of mint or gold-worker till the season of
coining or fashioning should come round. The translucent
flesh-tints, pearl-white flushing into pink—"Bouguereau
realized at last," as Nannie Wetmore
was in the habit of summing up her cousin&#39;s complexion—was
as marvellous as ever. The delicate
firmness of profile gave to the face the artificial
perfection of an old miniature, rather than of a
flesh-and-blood countenance, and all these were
there as of yore, but the marvel of them failed of the
customary tribute. Kitty, on scanty reflection, was
at no loss to translate Peter&#39;s reserve into a language
at once flattering and retributive. In her scheme
of life he was always to be her devoted cavalier, as
indeed he had been from the beginning. She loved
her own small eminence too well to imperil her
tenure of it by sharing its pretty view of men and
things with any one. In country house parties she
loved the mild wonder that the successful <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">littérateuse</span>
could fight and play and win her social triumphs so
well. She loved the star part, and next to playing
it she enjoyed wresting it from other women or
eclipsing them completely in some conspicuously
minor rôle, while, in the matter of dress, Miss
Colebrooke went beyond the point decreed by the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span>
<a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
most exigent mandates of fashion. When hats were
worn over the face, her admirers had to content
themselves with a glimpse of her charming mouth
and chin. When they flared, hers fairly challenged
the laws of equilibrium. She danced with the same
facility with which she rode, swam, and played
tennis. In doing these things supremely well she
felt that she vindicated the position of the woman
of letters. Why should one be a frump because one
wrote?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Her friendship with Peter was to endure to greenest
old age, more platonic, perhaps, than that of
Madame Récamier and Chateaubriand. It was to be
fruitful in letters that would compare favorably
with the best of the seventeenth century series.
Even now her own letters to Peter were no sprightly
scrawl of passing events, but efforts whose seriousness
suggested, at least in their carefully elaborated
stages of structure, the letters of the ladies of
Cranford.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But in the course of these Western wanderings,
undertaken not wholly without consideration of
Peter, there had appeared in the maplike exactness
of her plans an indefinite territory that threatened
undreamed-of proportions. It menaced the scheme
of the letters, it shook the foundations of the
Chateaubriand-Récamier friendship. The unknown
quantity was none other than the frequent and irritating
mention of one Judith Rodney, who, from
all accounts, appeared a half-breed. Her name, her
beauty, some intrinsic charm of personality made
her an all too frequent topic, except in the case of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span>
<a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Peter. He had been singularly keen in scenting
any interrogatory venue that led to the mysterious
half-breed; when questioned he persistently refused
to exhibit her as a type.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Kitty knew that she had treated her long-suffering
cavalier with scant consideration the day he
had spurred across the desert to see her. True, she
had written him on her arrival, but, with feminine
perversity of logic, thought it a trifle inconsiderate
of him to come so soon after that trying railroad
journey. An ardent resumption of his suit—and
Peter could be depended on for renewing it early and
often—was farthest from her inclination at that
particular time. She intended to salve her conscience
at the wolf-hunt for her casual reception of
his impetuous visit. But apparently Peter did not
intend to be prodigal of opportunity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How garrulous you people are this morning!"
Nannie Wetmore challenged them. Peter came out
of his brown study with the look of one who has
again returned to earth.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You don&#39;t find it like the drop-curtain of a
theatre, now that you&#39;ve seen it?" he questioned
Kitty. For she had doubted her pleasure in the
mountains, in the conviction that they would be too
dramatic for her simple taste.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Kitty closed her eyes and sighted the peaks as if
she were getting the color scheme for an afternoon
toilet.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Mass, bulk, rather than line—no, it&#39;s not like a
drop-curtain, but it&#39;s distinctly &#39;hand-painted.&#39; All

<a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
great cliff. It&#39;s the kind of thing that would sound
well in a description. Oh, I assure you I intend to
make lavish use of it, but it leaves nothing to one&#39;s
poor imagination!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter had a distinct feeling of being annoyed.
No, she could not appreciate the mountains any
more than they could appreciate her. They were
incongruous, antipathetic, antipodal. Kitty, in her
pink and white and flaxen prettiness and her trim
habit, was in harmony with the bridle-path of a city
park; in this great, lonely country she was an alien.
He thought of Judith and the night they had climbed
Horse-Thief Trail, of her quiet endurance, her keen
pleasure in the wild beauty of the night, her quality
of companionship, her loyalty, her silent bearing
of many burdens. Yet until he had seen them both
against the same relentless background, he had
never been conscious of comparing the two women.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Nannie Wetmore had fallen behind. She was
riding with a bronzed young lieutenant from Fort
Washakie. The two ahead rode long without speaking.
Then Peter broke the silence impatiently:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You did not really mean that, did you?" He
was boyishly hurt at her flippant summing up of his
beloved blue country. And Kitty, tired with the
long, hard ride, and missing that something in Peter
that had always been hers, turned on him a pair of
blue eyes in which the tears were brimming suspiciously.
They were well out of sight of the others,
and had come to the heavy fringes of a pine wood.
Was it the psychological moment at last? Then
suddenly their horses, that had been sniffing the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span>
<a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
air suspiciously, stopped. Kitty&#39;s horse, which was
in advance of Peter&#39;s, rushed towards the thicker
growth of pines as if all Bedlam were in pursuit.
Peter&#39;s horse, swerving from the cause of alarm,
bolted back across the trail over which they had
just made their way. A large brown bear, feeding
with her cub, and hidden by the trees till they were
directly in front of her, had caused the alarm.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And presently the hush of the shadowy green
world in which Judith lay was broken by a light,
sobbing sound. It had been so still that, lying on
her bed of pine-needles, she had likened it to great
waves of silence, rolling up from the valley, breaking
over her and sweeping back again, noiseless,
green from the billowing ocean of pine branches, and
sunlit. Judith bent over the rocky ledge and saw a
girl making her way down the game trail, dishevelled
and tearful. Her hat was gone, her pale-yellow
hair, that in shadow had the greenish tinge of corn-silk,
blew about her shoulders, her trim skirt was
torn and dusty, and she looked about, bewildered,
hardly realizing that through the unexpected course
of things she had been stranded in this great world
of sunlit splendor and loneliness. She closed her
eyes. The awful vastness and solitude oppressed
her with a deepening sense of calamity. Suppose
they never found her? How could she find her way
in this endless wilderness, afoot? She sank to the
turf and began to cry hysterically.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith knew in a flash of instant cognition that
this was Miss Colebrooke. Amazement seemed to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span>
<a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have dulled her powers of action—amazement that
she, who had stolen to this place and crouched close
to earth that she might see the triumph of this
preferred woman, and, having seen and paid her
grievous dole, steal away and take up the thread
of endless little things that spun for her the web of
life, was forced instead to be an unwilling witness
of the other&#39;s distress. Judith had risen with her
first impulse, which had been to go to Kitty, but
half-way through the thicket she hesitated and
reconsidered. Undoubtedly Peter would come soon,
and Peter&#39;s consolation would be more potent than
any she could offer. She shrank in shuddering self-consciousness
at the thought of her presence at
their meeting, the uninvited guest, the outgrown
friend and confidante, blundering in at such a time,
pitifully full of good intentions. She recoiled from
the picture as from a precipice that all unwittingly
she had escaped. What madness had induced her
to come on this expedition? A sudden panic at
the possibility of discovery possessed her; suppose
Peter should find her skulking like a beggar, waiting
for broken meats? She looked at the image of
herself that she carried in her heart. It was that
of a proud woman who made no moan at the scourge
of the inevitable. Many burdens had she carried
in her proud, lonely heart, but of them her lips gave
no sign. In her contemplative stoicism she felt
with pride that she was no unworthy daughter of
her mother&#39;s people, and catching a glimpse through
the trees of the abjectly waiting woman who, though
safe and sound, could but wait, wretched and dispirited,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span>
<a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for some one to come and adjust her to the
situation, Judith felt for her a wondering pity at her
helplessness. She waited, expectant, for the sound
of Peter&#39;s horse. Surely he must come at any
moment, overcome with apologies, and she—Judith
hid her face in her hands at the thought—she
would steal away through the thicket at the first
sound of hoofs. But as the minutes slipped by and
still no sign of Peter, a sickening anxiety began to
gnaw at her heart. Had something happened to
him?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She did not wait to ask herself the question twice.
She crawled the length of the thicket with incredible
rapidity, gained the pine forest, and made
her way beneath the low-hanging boughs; without
stopping to protect herself from them she gained
the open space and ran quickly to Kitty.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Are you hurt? What has happened?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Kitty looked up, startled at the voice. She had
not heard the sound of the moccasined feet. Her
wandering, forlorn thoughts crystallized at sight of
the woman before her. A new lightning leaped into
her eyes as she recognized Judith. There was between
them a thrilling consciousness that gave to
their mutual perception a something sharp and fine,
that grasped the drama of the moment with the
precision and fidelity of a camera. And through
all the wonder of the meeting there was in the heart
of each an outflowing that met and mingled and
understood the potential tragedy element of the
situation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You are Miss Rodney, I believe?"</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span>
<a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Kitty was conscious of something strange in her
voice as she looked into the dark eyes, wide with
questioning fear. Ah, but she had amazing beauty,
and a something that seemed of the very essence of
deep-souled womanliness! The two women presented
a fine bit of antithesis, Kitty, flower-like,
small, delicately wrought, the finished product of
the town, exotic as some rare transplanted orchid
growth. And in Judith there was a gemlike quality:
it was in the bloom of her skin, the iridescent
radiance of her hair, that was bluish, like a plum in
sunlight; it was in the warm, red life in her lips, in
the pulsing vitality of the slim, brown throat; in
every line was sensuous force restrained by spiritual
passion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Kitty told of the accident in which her horse had
thrown her and disappeared in the pine fringes,
leaving her stunned for a moment or two; and how
she had finally pulled herself together and followed
what appeared to be a trail, in the hope of finding
some one. She dwelt long on the details of the
accident.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, but Peter, what has happened him?"
Judith chose her words impatiently. She was
racked with anxiety at his long delay, and now
she hung over Kitty, waiting for her answer, without
the semblance of a cloak for her alarm.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There was reproof in Kitty&#39;s amendment. "I
don&#39;t know which way Mr. Hamilton&#39;s horse went.
It started back over the trail, I think."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith clasped her hands. "Let us go and look
for him. Why do we waste time?" But Kitty
<span class="tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span>
<a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hung back. She was shaken from her fall, and upset
by the events of the morning. Besides, her faith in
Peter&#39;s ability to cope with all the exigencies of this
country was supreme. And chiefest reason of all
for her not going was a something within her that
winced at the thought of this fellowship that had
for its object the quest of Peter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, don&#39;t you see," pleaded Judith, "that if
something had not happened to him he would have
been here long ago?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith&#39;s anxiety awoke in Kitty a new consciousness.
What was she to him, that at the possibility
of harm, a fear not shared by Kitty, she should
throw off a reserve that every line of her face pronounced
habitual? In her very energy of attitude,
an energy that all unconsciously communicated
itself to Kitty, there was the power that belongs to
all elemental human emotion—the power that compels.
Kitty rose to follow Judith, then hesitated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;m sure nothing has happened him. No, I&#39;m
really too unstrung by my fall to walk." She
sank again to the bowlder on which she had been
sitting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">To the woman of the world, Judith&#39;s ingenuous
display of feeling had in its very sincerity a something
pitiable. How could she strip from her soul
every fold of reserve and stand unloved and unashamed,
sanctified, as it were, by the very hopelessness
of her passion? How could women make
of their whole existence a thing to be rejected,
reflected Kitty, who, giving nothing, could not
understand. She looked again at the bronzed face
<span class="tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span>
<a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
beside her, so bold in outline, so expressive in detail.
Yes, she was beautiful, and yet, what had her beauty
availed her? The thought that she herself was the
preferred woman throbbed through her for a moment
with a sense of exaltation. The next moment a
haunting doubt laid hold of her heart, held up
mockingly the little that she and Peter had lived
through together, the lofty plane of friendship along
which she had tried to lead his unwilling feet
sedately, his protests, his frank amusement at her
serious pretensions to a career. How much fuller
might not have been the intercourse between him
and this woman, who, in all probability, had been
his comrade for years? And she had been idealizing
him, and his love for her, and his loneliness! Kitty
stood with eyes cast down, while images crowded
upon her, leaving her cold and smiling.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But think," pleaded Judith; "if you don&#39;t come
it will take me longer to search the trail-marks.
You could show me just where the horses ran—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Kitty&#39;s eyes were still on the ground. She did not
lift them, and Judith, realizing that further appeal
was but a waste of time, turned and ran swiftly
down the trail.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He is her lover," said Kitty; and all the wilderness
before her was no lonelier than her heart.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Swift, intent, Judith traced Kitty&#39;s footprints.
They followed the game trail, the one she herself
had taken earlier in the day. She traced them
back through the pine wood about a hundred rods,
and then the trail-marks grew confused. This was
unquestionably the place where the horses had taken
<span class="tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span>
<a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fright, circled, reared, then dashed in different
directions. She traced the other horse, whose
tracks led under low-hanging boughs. It would
have been a difficult matter for a horse with a rider
to clear; and now the impression of the horse&#39;s shoes
grew fainter, from the lighter footfalls of a horse
at full gallop.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Ah!" A cry broke from her as she saw the marks
had become almost eliminated by something that
had dragged, something heavy. Those long-drawn
lines were finger-prints, where a hand had dragged
in its vain endeavor to grasp at something. A
sickening image came persistently before her eyes—Peter&#39;s
upturned face, blood-smeared and disfigured.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Sh-sh-sh!" She put her hand to her breast to
still the beating of her heart. She could hear the
sound of hoofs falling muffled on the soft ground,
and a man&#39;s voice speaking in a soothing sing-song.
She listened. It was Peter&#39;s voice, reassuring the
horse, asking him what kind of a bag of nerves he
was for a cow pony, to get frightened at a bear?
Judith stood tall and straight among the pines.
Surely he could not blindly pass her by. He must
feel the joy in her heart that all was well with him.
The hoofs came nearer, the man&#39;s voice sounded
but intermittently, as he got his horse under better
control. She felt as if he must come to her, as if
some overpowering consciousness of her presence
would speak from her heart to his; but his eyes
scanned the distant trail for a glimpse of Kitty or
Kitty&#39;s horse. Judith saw that his head was bound
<span class="tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span>
<a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in something white and that it bore a red stain, but
he held himself well in the saddle. He was not the
man to heed a tumble. He urged the horse forward,
never looking towards the tree-trunks, his face
white and strained with anxiety as he scoured
the trail for evidences of Kitty. The horse, with
a keener sense than his master, shied slightly as
he passed the group of pines where Judith stood;
but Peter&#39;s glance was for the open trail, and as she
heard him canter by, so close that she could have
touched his stirrup with her hand, it seemed as if
he must hear the beating of her heart.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, blind eyes, and ears that will not hear, and
heart that has forgotten how to beat! Yes, go to
that pale, cold girl! You speak one language, and
life for you is the way of little things!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She waited till the last sound of the horse&#39;s hoofs
had died away and all was still in the tremulous
green of the forest. Judith&#39;s mind was busy with
the image of their meeting, the man bringing the
joy of his youth to the calm divinity who could feel
no thrill of fear in his absence. She broke into the
running gait and hurried through the forest to the
Daxes&#39;.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">In The Land Of The Red Silence</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The beef-herd, that had been the pivotal point
of the round-up and had made the mighty
plain echo to its stampings and bellowings, beating
up simooms that choked it with thirst, blinded it
with dust, confounding itself on every side by the
very fury of its blind force, had trailed for a week,
tractable as toys in the hands of children. Little
had happened to vary the monotony for the cow-punchers
that handled the herd—they grazed,
guarded, watered, night-herded the cattle day after
day, night after night. Pasturage had been sufficient,
if not abundant. The creeks were running
low and slimy with the advance of summer, but
there had been sufficient water to let the herd drink
its fill at least once a day.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The outfit ate its "sow-belly," soda-biscuit, and
coffee three times a day, and smoked its pipes, but
was a little shy on yarns round the camp-fire.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"This yere outfit don&#39;t lather none," commented
the cook to the horse-wrangler, over the smoke of
an early morning fire.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t lather no more than a chunk of wood,"
agreed the horse-wrangler. "That&#39;s the trouble
<span class="tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span>
<a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with a picked-up outfit like this. Catch &#39;W-square&#39;
men kowtowing to a &#39;XXX&#39; boss, even if he is only
acting foreman."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Simpson, the origin of whose connection with the
"XXX" was rather a sensitive subject with that
outfit, had begun to take his duties as a cattle-man
with grim seriousness; he was untiring in his
labors; he spent long hours in the saddle, he took
his turn at night herding, though he was old for
this kind of work. He condemned the sheep-men
with foul-mouthed denunciations, scoffed at their
range-rights, said the sheep question should be
dealt with in the business-like manner in which
the Indian question had been settled. He was an
advocate of violence—in short, a swaggering, bombastic
wind-bag. He talked much of "his outfit"
and "his men." "What was good enough for them
was good enough for him," he would announce at
meal-time, in a snivelling tone, when the food happened
to be particularly bad. He split the temporary
outfit, brought together for the purpose of
handling the beef-herd, into factions. He put the
"XXX" in worse repute than it already enjoyed—he
was, in fact, the discordant spirit of the expedition.
The men attended to their work sullenly.
Discord was rife. The one thought they shared in
common was that of the wages that would come to
them at the end of the drive; of the feverish joy of
"blowing in," in a single night; perchance, of forgetting,
in one long, riotous evening, the monotony,
the hardship, the lack of comradery that made
this particular drive one long to be remembered
<span class="tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span>
<a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the mind of every man who had taken part
in it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Meanwhile the herd trailed its half-mile length
to the slaughtering pens day after day, all unconscious
of its power. When the steers had trailed
for about a fortnight, the question of finding sufficient
water for them began to be a serious one.
The preceding winter had been unusually mild,
the snow-fall on the mountains averaging less than
in the recollection of the oldest plains-man. Summer
had begun early and waxed hot and dry. The earth
began to wrinkle, and cracked into trenches, like
gaping mouths, thirsty for the water that came not.
Such streams as had not dried shrank and crawled
among the willows like slimy things, that the herd,
thirsty though it was from the long drives, had to
be coaxed to drink from.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Discontent grew. The acting foreman, who was
a "XXX" man, and a comparative stranger to
that part of the country, refused to consult with the
"W-square" men in the outfit, who knew every
inch of the ground. The acting foreman thought
the Wetmore men looked down on him, "put on
dog"; and, to flaunt his authority, he ordered the
herd driven due west instead of skirting to the
north by the longer route, where they would have
had the advantage of drinking at several creeks
before crossing Green River. Moreover, the acting
foreman was drinking hard, and he insisted upon his
order in spite of the Wetmore men&#39;s protestations.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The character of the country began to change, the
soil took on the color of blood, even the omnipresent
<span class="tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span>
<a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sage-brush began to fail the landscape; sun-bleached
bones glistened on the red soil, white as ulcers.
All the animal trails led back from the country into
which they were proceeding. The sky, a vivid,
cloudless blue, paled as it dipped earthward. The
sun looked down, a flaming copper shield. There
was no sign of life in all the land. Even the grasshoppers
had left it to the sun, the silence, and the
desolation. To ears accustomed to the incessant
shrilling of the insects, the cessation was ominous,
like the sudden stopping of a clock in a chamber
of death. Above the angry bellow of the thirsty
herd the men strained their ears again and again
for this familiar sound of life, but there was nothing
but the bellowing of the cattle, the trampling of
their hoofs, and sometimes the long, squealing
whinny of a horse as he threw back his head in
seeming demand to know the justice of this thing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Across the red plain snailed the herd, like a
many-jointed, prehistoric reptile wandering over
the limitless spaces of some primeval world. A
cloud of red dust hung over them in a dense haze,
trailed after them a weary length, then all was
featureless monotony as before. What were a thousand
steers, a handful of men and horses, in the
land of the red silence? It had seen the comings
and goings of many peoples, and once it had flowed
with streams; but that was before the curse of God
came upon it, and in its harsh, dry barrenness it
grew to be a menace to living things.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The saddle-stock had been watered at some
fetid alkali holes that had scarce given enough to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span>
<a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
slake their thirst. The effect of the water had
weakened them, and the steers that had been without
water for thirty-six hours were being pushed on
a course slightly northwest as rapidly as the enfeebled
condition of the saddle-horses would permit.
Creek after creek that they had made for proved to
be but a dry bed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The glare of the red earth, under the scourge of
the flaming sun, tormented the eyes of the men into
strange illusions. The naked red plain stretched
flat like the colossal background of a screen, over
which writhed a huge dragon, spined with many
horns, headless, trailing its tortuous way over the
red world. Sometimes it was as unreal as a fever-haunted
dream, a drug-inspired nightmare, when a
Chinese screen, perchance, has stood at the foot of
the sleeper&#39;s bed. Sometimes the dragon curled
itself into a ball, and the foreman sung out that they
were milling, and the men turned and rode away
from it, then dashed back at it, after getting the
necessary momentum, entered like a flying wedge,
fought their way into the rocking sea of surging
bodies, shouted from their thirst-parched throats
imprecations that were lost in the dull, sullen roar.
Then the dragon would uncoil and again trail its
way over the red waste-lands.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A red sun had begun to set over a red earth, and
the men who had been out since noon-scouring the
country for water, returned to say that none had
been found, and they began to look into each
other&#39;s faces for the answer that none could give.
At sunset they made a dry camp; there was but
<span class="tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span>
<a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
enough water left to cook with. Each man received,
as a thirst-quenching ration, a can of tomatoes.
After supper they consulted, and it was agreed to
trail the herd till midnight, taking advantage of
the coolness to hurry them on as fast as possible
to Green River. The grave nature of their plight
was indicated by the fact that no one smoked after
supper. Silent, sullen, they sat round, waiting for
the foreman to give the order to advance. He
waited for the moon to come up. Slowly it rose
over the Bad Land Hills and hung round and full
like a gigantic lantern. The watches were arranged
for the night with a double guard. Every man in
the outfit was beginning to have a feeling of panic
that communicated itself to every other man, and
as they looked at the herd, tractable now no longer,
but a blind force that they must take chances with
through the long watches of the night, while the
thirst grew in the beasts&#39; parched throats, they
foresaw what would in all probability happen; they
thought of their women, of all that most strongly
bound them to life, and they sat and waited
dumbly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The moon that night was too brilliant for benisons;
the gaunt, red world lay naked and unshriven for the
sin that long ago had brought upon it the wrath of
God. The picture was still that of the grotesque
Chinese screen, with the headless dragon crawling
endlessly; but the dream was long, centuries long,
it seemed to the men listening to the bellowing of
the herd. And while they waited, the red grew
dull and the dragon dingy, and its fury made its
<span class="tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span>
<a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
contortions the more horrible; and that was all
the difference between day and night in the land of
the red silence. Sometimes the dragon split, and
joints of it tried to turn back to the last water it
had drunk; for cattle, though blinded with thirst,
never forget the last stream at which they have
quenched thirst, and will turn back to it, though
they drop on the way. But the men pressed them
farther and farther, and for yet a little while the
cattle yielded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At midnight the saddle-stock was incapable of
moving farther. One horse had fallen and lay too
weak to rise. The others, limping and foot-sore,
no longer responded to quirt and rowel. The foreman
ordered the herd thrown on the bed ground
for the night. The herders for the first watch
began to circle. The rest of the outfit took to its
blankets to snatch a little rest for the double duty
that awaited every man that night. Now it is a
time-honored belief among cow-men that the herd
must be sung to, particularly when it is restless,
and to-night they tried all the old favorites, the
"Cow-boy&#39;s Lament" being chief among them. But
the herd refused to be soothed, and round and
round it circled; not once would it lie down.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The moon gleamed almost brazen, showing the
cruel scars, the trenches torn by cloud-bursts, the
lines wrought by the long, patient waiting of the
earth for the lifting of the wrath of God. Imperishable
grief was writ on the land as on a human face.
The night wore on, the watches changed, the herd
continued restless; not more than a third of it had
<span class="tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span>
<a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bedded down. The third watch was from one
o&#39;clock to half-past three in the morning. Simpson
and another "XXX" man, with two of the Wetmore
outfit, made up a double watch, and rode,
singing, about the herd, as the long, dreary watch
wore away. The cattle&#39;s lowing had taken on a
gasping, cracked sound that was more frightful
than the maddened bellow of the early evening.
Simpson, who was past the age when men live the
life of the saddle, felt the hardship keenly. He had
ridden since sunrise, but for the respite at noon
and the scant time at the dry camp while the evening
meal was being eaten. He was more than
half asleep now, as he lurched heavily in the saddle,
crossing and recrossing his partner in the half-circle
they completed about the herd. Suddenly
the sharp yelp of a coyote rang out; it seemed to
come from no farther than twenty yards away.
The cattle heard it, too, and a wave of panic swept
through them. Simpson stiffened in his saddle.
The sound, which was repeated, was an exact reproduction
of a coyote&#39;s yelp, yet he knew that it
was not a coyote.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The herd rose to its feet as a single steer, and for a
second stood undetermined. From a clump of sage-brush
not more than two feet high fluttered something
long and white like a sheet. It waved in the
wind as the cry was repeated. The herd crashed
forward in a stampede, Simpson in the lead on a
tired horse, but a scant length ahead of a thousand
maddened steers bolting in a panic of thirst and
fear.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span>
<a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Hell&#39;s loose!" yelled the men in their blankets,
making for the temporary rope corral to secure
horses. Simpson, tallow-colored with fear, clung
like a cat to his horse, and dug the rowels in the
beast&#39;s flanks till they were bloody and dripping.
He had seen Jim Rodney&#39;s face above the white
cloth as it fluttered in the face of the herd that came
pounding behind him with the rumble of nearing
thunder. He was too close to them to attempt
to fire his revolver in the air in the hope of turning
them, but the boys had evidently got into their
saddles, to judge by the volley of shots that rang out
and were answered. Simpson alone rode ahead of
the herd that tore after him, ripping up the earth
as it came, bellowing in its blind fury. His horse,
a thoroughly seasoned cow-pony, sniffed the bedlam
and responded to the goading spur. She had been
in cattle stampedes before, and, though every fibre
ached with fatigue, she flattened out her lean body
and covered ground to the length of her stride at
each gallop. The herd was so close that Simpson
could smell the stench of their sweating bodies,
taste their dust, and feel the scorch of their breath.
The sound of their hoofs was like the pounding of a
thousand propellers. From above looked the moon,
round and serene; she had watched the passing of
many peoples in the land of the red silence. The
horse seemed to be gaining. A few more lengths
ahead and Simpson could turn her to one side and
let the maddened cattle race to their own destruction.
All he asked of God was to escape their trampling
hoofs, and though he gained he dug the rowel
<span class="tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span>
<a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and plied the quirt, unmindful of what he did. On
they came; the chorus of their fear swelled like the
voice of a mighty cataract, the pound, pound, pound
of their hoofs ringing like mighty sledge-hammers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Suddenly he felt himself sinking, horribly, irresistibly.
"God! What is it?" as his horse went
down with her foreleg in a gopher-hole. "Up, up,
you damned brute!" but the mare&#39;s leg had cracked
like a pipe-stem. In his fury at the beast Simpson
began kicking her, then started to run as the cattle
swept forward like a black storm-cloud.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The next second the great sea of cattle had broken
over horse and rider. When it had passed there
was not enough left of either to warrant burial or to
furnish a feast for the buzzards. A few shreds of
clothes, that had once been a man, lay scattered
there; a something that had been a horse.</p>

<a name="toc_18" id="toc_18"></a>
<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">Mrs. Yellett Contends With A Cloudburst</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The matriarch had delayed longer in moving
camp than was consistent with her habitual
watchfulness where the interests of the sheep were
involved. Mary Carmichael, who had already become
inured to the experience of moving, was even
conscious of a certain impatience at the delay, and
could only explain the apathy with which Mrs. Yellett
received reports of the dearth of pasturage on
the ground that she wished each fresh educational
germ to take as deep root as possible before transplantation.
So that when Mrs. Yellett, shortly after
Leander Dax&#39;s arrival at camp in the capacity of
herder, announced that she and Leander were to
make a trip to the dipping-vat that had kept Ben
from his classes for the past ten days, and invited
the "gov&#39;ment" to join the expedition, Mary accepted
with fervor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The Yelletts&#39; "bunch" of sheep did not exceed
three thousand head, and the matriarch had wisely
decreed that it should be restricted to that number,
as she wished always to give the flock her personal
supervision.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span>
<a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;The hen that&#39;s the surest of her chicks is the one
that does her own settin&#39;,&#39;" was the adage from the
Book of Hiram with which Mrs. Yellett succinctly
summed up the case.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Each autumn, therefore, the wethers and the
dry-bag ewes were sent to the market, and as the
result of continual weeding of the stock the matriarch
had as promising a herd of its size as could
be found in Wyoming. Often she had explained to
Mary, who was learning of the wonders of this new
world with remarkable aptness, that she had constantly
to fight against the inclination to increase
her business of sheep-raising, but that as soon as she
should begin to hire herders or depend on strangers
things would go wrong. With the assistance of her
sons, she therefore managed the entire details of the
herd, with the exception of those occasions on which
Leander lent his semi-professional co-operation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As a workman Leander was, considering his size
and apparent weakness, surprisingly efficient. It
was as a dispenser of anti-theological doctrine that
Mrs. Dax&#39;s husband annoyed his temporary employer.
Freed from his wife&#39;s masterful presence,
Leander dared to be an "agnostic," as he called
himself, of an unprecedentedly violent order. His
iconoclasm was not of a pattern with paw&#39;s gusty
protests against life in general, but it was Leander&#39;s
way of asserting himself, on the rare occasions when
he got a chance, to deny clamorously every tenet
advanced by every religion. The mere use of certain
familiar expletives drove him, ordinarily mild and
submissive though he was, to frantic gesticulation
<span class="tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span>
<a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and diatribe. Mary Carmichael could not make out,
as she watched the comedy with growing amusement,
whether poor Leander really believed that he
was the first of doubting Thomases, or whether
he took an unfair advantage of the lack of general
information in his casual audiences to set forth
well-known opinions as his own. Whatever its
basis may have been, Leander sustained the rôle
of doubter with passionate zeal, wearing himself
to tatters of rage and hoarseness over arguments
maliciously contrived beforehand by cow-punchers
and sheep-herders in need of amusement; and yet
he never saw the traps, going out of his way, apparently,
to fall into them, tumbling headlong into
the identical pits time after time. Jonah and the
whale constituted one bait by means of which Leander
could be lured from food, sleep, or work of the
most pressing nature.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The poor fool would stop in the middle of shearing
a sheep to argue that Jonah never come out of the
whale&#39;s belly," the matriarch had told Mary Carmichael,
in summing up Leander&#39;s disadvantages as a
herder. And the first remark she had addressed to
him on his arrival was: "Leander Dax, you&#39;d have
to be made over, and made different, to keep you
from bein&#39; a infidel, but there&#39;s one p&#39;int on which
you are particularly locoed, and that&#39;s Jonah and
the whale. Now at this particular time in the hist&#39;ry
of the United States, nobody in his faculties has
got no call to fret hisself over Jonah and his whereabouts—none
whatever. There&#39;s a lot of business
round this here camp that&#39;s a heap more pressin&#39;.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span>
<a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Now, Leander Dax, if I do hereby undertake to hire,
engage, and employ you to herd sheep, do you agree
to renounce discussions, arguments, and debates
on the late Jonah and his whereabouts durin&#39; them
three days? God A&#39;mighty, man, any one would
think you was Jonah&#39;s wife, the interest you have
in his absence!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I come here to herd sheep," Leander had brazenly
retaliated. "I &#39;ain&#39;t come to try to make you
think."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Nevertheless, he appeared docile enough as the
time came for the journey to the dipping-vat, and
did his part in making ready. The wagon was
the rudest of structures; it consisted merely of one
long, stout pole. Though she saw the horses being
harnessed to this pole, Mary Carmichael, discreetly
exercising her newly acquired wisdom, forbore to
ask where she was going to sit, and listened with
interest to a discussion between Mrs. Yellett and
Leander as to the number of horses it would take to
get the dip up the mountain. Leander, who loved
pomp and splendor, was for taking six, but Mrs.
Yellett, who carried simplicity to a fault, was in
favor of only two. They finally compromised on
four, and Leander went to fetch the extra two.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Yellett, ever economical of the flitting moment,
took advantage of the delay to give Mr. Yellett
a dose of "Brainard&#39;s Beneficial Blackthorn."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Paw&#39;s as hard to manage as a bent pin," she
remarked, in an aside to Mary, while he protested
and fought her off with his stick. But she, with the
agility of an acrobat, got directly back of him, took
<span class="tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span>
<a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his head under her arm, pried open his mouth, and
poured down the unwelcome, if beneficial, dose.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There, there, paw," she said, wiping his mouth
as if he had been a baby, "don&#39;t take on so! It&#39;s
all gone, and I can&#39;t have you sick on my hands."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But Mr. Yellett continued to splutter and flare
and use violent language, whereupon the matriarch
went into the tent and returned with a drink of
condensed-milk and water, "to wash down the
nasty taste," she told him, soothingly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A moment afterwards she and Leander were engaged
in rolling the barrels of sheep-dip to the wagon,
Mary Carmichael helplessly looking on while
Mrs. Yellett looked doubtfully at a "gov&#39;ment"
who could not handle barrels. Finally, under the
skilful manipulation of Mrs. Yellett and Leander,
the long pole took on the aspect of a colossal vertebral
column, from which huge barrel-ribs projected
horizontally, leaving at the rear a foot or so of bare
pole as a smart caudal appendage, bearing about the
same proportion to the wagon as the neatly bitten
tail of a fox-terrier does to the dog.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Yellett kissed "paw" good-bye, explaining
to Mary, in extenuation of her weakness, that she
would never forgive herself if she neglected it and
anything happened to him during her absence. She
then climbed to the front barrel and secured the
ribbons. Leander had brought out three rolls of
bedding of the inevitable bed-quilt variety, but
Mrs. Yellett scorned such luxury while driving,
and accordingly gave hers to the "gov&#39;ment" for a
back-rest. Mary sat on the lower row of barrels,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span>
<a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with her feet dangling, using one roll of bedding for
a seat and the other comfortably arranged at her
back as a cushion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Madam called sharply to the horses, "Hi-hi-hi-kerat!
hi-kerat-kerat!" and they started off at
a rattling pace, the barrels of dip creaking and
squeaking as they swayed under their rope lashings.
Mary bounced about like a bean in a bag, working
loose from between the bed-quilt rolls at each gulley,
clinging frantically to barrel ends, shaken back
and forth like a shuttle. Indeed, the drive seemed
to combine every known form of physical exercise.
Mrs. Yellett herself was in fine fettle; she drove
sitting for a while, then rose, standing on a narrow
ledge while she held the four ribbons lightly in one
hand and tickled the leaders with a long whip carried
in the other. She drove her four horses over
the rough road with the skill of a circus equestrienne,
balancing easily on the crazy ledge, shifting her
weight from side to side as the wagon rattled down
gullies and up ridges, the horses responding gallantly
to the shrill "Hi-hi-kerat! hi-kerat! hi-kerat!"
Her costume on this occasion represented joint concessions
to her sex and the work that was before her,
as the head of a family at the dipping-vat. She
still wore the drum-shaped rabbit-skin cap pulled
well down over her forehead for driving. The great,
cable-like braids of hair stood out well below the
cap, giving her head an appearance of denseness
and solidity, but the rambling curls were still blowing
about her face, perhaps adding to the sum total
of grotesqueness. She wore a man&#39;s shirt of gray
<span class="tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span>
<a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
flannel, well open at the neck, from which the
bronzed column of the throat rose in austere dignity.
A pair of Mr. Yellett&#39;s trousers, stuffed into high,
cow-puncher&#39;s boots, that met the hem of a skirt
coming barely to the knees, contributed to the
originality of her dress.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The wagon had been pitching like a ship at sea
through the desert dreariness for about an hour,
when Mary Carmichael suddenly became conscious
that the prods she had been receiving from time to
time in her back were not due either to their manner
of locomotion or to the freight carried. Clinging
to two barrels, she waited for the next lurch of the
wagon to shake her free from the rolls of bedding,
and, at the peril of life and limb, looked round.
Leander hung over the top row of barrels, gesticulating
wildly. The change in the man, since leaving
camp some two hours previous, was appalling. He
seemed to have shrivelled away to a wraith of his
former self. His cheeks, his chin, had waned to the
vanishing point. He opened his lips and mouthed
horribly, yet his frightful grimacings conveyed no
meaning. Mary called to Mrs. Yellett, but her
voice was drowned in the rattle of the wagon, the
clatter of four horses&#39; hoofs, and the continual
"Hi-hi-hi-kerat! hi-kerat!" of the driver. In the
mean time Leander pointed to his mouth and back
to the road in indescribably pathetic pantomime.
"Perhaps the poor creature wants to turn back and
die in his bed, like a Christian, even if he isn&#39;t one,"
thought Mary, as she called and called, Leander still
emitting the most inhuman of cries, like the sounds
<span class="tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span>
<a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
made by deaf mutes in distress. Presently Mrs.
Yellett drew up, and asked in the name of many
profane things what was the matter with her
companions.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Leander resumed his mouthings and his dumb
show, but Mrs. Yellett proved a better interpreter
than Mary Carmichael.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"God A&#39;mighty!" she said, "he&#39;s lost his false
teeth!" And without another word she turned the
four horses and the wagon with a skill that fell little
short of sleight-of-hand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The dialogue that followed between Mrs. Yellett
and Leander as to how far back he had dropped his
teeth, cannot be given, owing to the inadequacy of
the English language to reproduce his toothless
enunciation. Catching, as Mary did, the meaning
of Mrs. Yellett&#39;s remarks only, she received something
of the one-sided impression given by overhearing
a telephone conversation:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What did you have &#39;em out for?... You didn&#39;t
have &#39;em out?... I just shook &#39;em out? Then
what made you have your mouth open? Ef your
mouth had been shut, you couldn&#39;t have lost &#39;em.... You
was a-yawnin&#39;, eh? Well, you are a plumb
fool to yawn on this kind of a waggin, with your
mouth full o&#39; china teeth. Your yawnin&#39; &#39;ll put us
back a good hour an&#39; we won&#39;t reach camp before
sundown."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At this point of the diatribe the Infidel left the
wagon and began to search along the road. He said
he had noticed a buffalo skull near the place where
he had dropped the teeth, and thought he could
<span class="tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span>
<a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
trace them by this landmark. Mrs. Yellett held
the ribbons and suggested that Mary get down
"and help to prospect for them teeth." As Mary
clambered down she heard a fragment of the matriarch&#39;s
monologue, which, being duly expurgated
for polite ears, was to the effect that she would
rather take ten babies anywhere than one grown
man, and that as for getting in the way, hindering,
obstructing, and being a nuisance, generally speaking,
man had not his counterpart in the scheme of
creation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Talk about a woman bein&#39; at the bottom of
everything!" sniffed Mrs. Yellett; "I be so sick of
always hearin&#39; about &#39;the woman in the case!&#39; Half
the time the case would be a blame sight worse if it
was left exclusive to the men. The Book of Hiram
says: &#39;A skunk may have his good p&#39;ints, but few
folks is takin&#39; the risk of waitin&#39; round to get acquainted
with &#39;em.&#39;"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">While Mary was still "prospecting," a glad cry
roused her attention, and Leander came up smiling,
with his dental treasures nicely adjusted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Quit smilin&#39; like a rattlesnake, you plumb fool!"
called out Mrs. Yellett. "Do you want to lose &#39;em
again?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">So, curtailing the muscular contraction indicative
of his pleasure, the Infidel again took his place among
the bed-quilts and the journey was resumed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was now about five in the afternoon. The
heat, which had been oppressive all day, suddenly
relaxed its blistering grip, and a keenly penetrating
dampness, not unlike that of a sea-fog, came from
<span class="tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span>
<a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
some unknown quarter of the arid wastes and
chilled the three travellers to the marrow. The
horses flung up their heads and sniffed it, rearing
and plunging as if they had scent of something
menacing. Across the horizon a dark cloud scudded,
no bigger than your hand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Cloud-burst!" announced Mrs. Yellett.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Cloud-burst, all right enough," agreed Leander,
and he turned up his coat-collar in simple preparation
for the deluge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There flashed into Mary Carmichael&#39;s mind a
sentence from her physical geography that she had
been obliged to commit to heart in her school-days:
"A cloud-burst is a sudden, capricious rainfall, as
if the whole cloud had been precipitated at once."
She wanted to question her companions as to the
accuracy of this definition, but before she had time
to frame a sentence the real cloud-burst came, with
a splitting crack of thunder; then the lightning
flashed out its message in the short-hand of the
storm, across the inky blackness, and the water fell
as if the ocean had been inverted. In the fraction
of a second all three were drenched to the skin, the
water pouring from them in sheets, as if they had
been some slight obstruction in the path of a waterfall.
The wagon was soon in a deep gully, with
frothing, foaming, yellow water up to the hubs of
the wheels. Mrs. Yellett, like some goddess of the
storm, lashed her horses forward to keep them from
foundering in the mud, and the wagon creaked and
groaned in all its timbers as it lurched and jolted
through the angry torrents.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span>
<a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Each moment Mary expected to be flung from the
barrels, and clung till her finger-tips were white and
aching. From the drenched red bedquilts a sticky
crimson trail ran over the barrel heads, as well as
over Mary&#39;s hands, face, and dress. Still they forged
on through the deluge, Mrs. Yellett shouting and
lashing the horses, holding them erect and safe with
the skill she never lost. The fur on her rabbit-skin
cap was beaten flat. The great, wet braids had fallen
from the force of the water and hung straight and
black, like huge snakes uncoiled. She was far from
losing her grip on either the horses or the situation,
and from the inspiring ring of her voice as she urged
them forward it was plain that she took a fierce
joy in this conflict of the elements.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was bitterly cold, and Mary reflected that if
Leander&#39;s teeth chattered half as hard as hers did,
without breaking, they must, indeed, be of excellent
quality. The storm began to abate, and the sky
became lighter, though the water still poured in
torrents. As soon as her responsibility as driver
left her time to speak, Mrs. Yellett lost no time in
fastening the cloud-burst to Leander.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"This here is what comes of settin&#39; up your back
against God A&#39;mighty and encouragin&#39; the heathen
and the infidel in his idolatry. I might &#39;a&#39; knowed
somethin&#39; would happen, takin&#39; you along! &#39;And
the heathen and the infidel went out, and the Lord
God sent a cloud-burst to wet him,&#39;" quoted Mrs.
Yellett from the apocryphal Scriptures that never
yet failed to furnish her with verse and text.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The infidel, from his side of the wagon, began to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span>
<a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
display agitation. His jaws worked, but he said
nothing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You &#39;ain&#39;t lost them teeth again, have you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He nodded his head wretchedly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;And the Lord took away the teeth of his enemy,
so that he could neither bite nor talk,&#39;" quoted Mrs.
Yellett to the miserable man, who could make no
reply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Wonder you wouldn&#39;t see the foolishness o&#39;
being a heathen and a infidel, and turn to the
Lord! You &#39;ain&#39;t got no teeth, and it takes your
wife to herd you. &#39;And the Lord multiplied the
tribulations of his enemy.&#39; You got no more show
standin&#39; up agin the Lord than an insect would have
standin&#39; up agin me."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She had Leander, at last, just where she wanted
him. He was forced to listen, and he could make
no reply. She alternately abused him for his lack
of faith and urged him to repentance. Leander
raged, gesticulated, turned his back on her, mouthed,
and finally put his fingers in his ears. But nothing
stemmed the tide of Mrs. Yellett&#39;s eloquence; it
was as inexhaustible and as remorseless as the
cloud-burst.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It continued bitterly cold, even after the rain had
stopped falling, and the heap of sodden bedclothes
furnished no protection against the chilling dampness.
It was growing dark; there was no red in the
sunset, only a streak of vivid orange along the
horizon, chill and clear as the empty, soulless flame
of burning paper. There were no deep, glowing
coals, no amethystine opalescence, fading into gold
<span class="tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span>
<a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and violet. All was cold and subdued, and the
scrub pines on the mountain-tops stood out sharply
against this cold background like an etching on
yellow paper.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mrs. Yellett&#39;s self-inspired scriptural maxims were
discontinued after a while, either because she could
think of no more, or because the rain-soaked,
shivering, chattering object towards which they
were directed was too abject to inspire further
efforts. Leander huddled on the barrel that was
farthest from Mrs. Yellett, and wrapped himself in
the soaked red bedquilt. The dye smeared his
face till he looked like an Indian brave ready for
battle, but there was no further suggestion of the
fighting red man in the utter desolation of his
attitude. Mary Carmichael, on her barrel, shivered
with grim patience and longed for a cup of tea. Only
Mrs. Yellett gave no sign of anxiety or discomfort;
she drove along, sometimes whistling, sometimes
swearing, erect as an Indian, and to all appearances
as oblivious of cold and wet as if she were in her
own home.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The gathering darkness into which the horses were
plunging was mysterious and appalling. Objects
stood out enormously magnified, or distorted grotesquely,
in the uncertain light. It was like penetrating
into the real Inferno, like stumbling across
the inspiration of Dante in all its sinister splendor.
It was the Inferno of his dream rather than the
Inferno of his poem; it had the ghastly reality of
the unreal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if we had a smash-up in
<span class="tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span>
<a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Clear Creek," said Mrs. Yellett, just by way of
adding her quota of cheerful speculation. She
ducked her head and whispered in Mary&#39;s ear:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It&#39;s all along of me hirin&#39; <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">him</span>! I wouldn&#39;t be
surprised if paw died. I&#39;m thinkin&#39; of shakin&#39; him
out after his teeth. &#39;Take not up with the enemy
of the Lord, lest he make of you also an enemy.&#39;"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But there was no accent of apprehension in Mrs.
Yellett&#39;s dismal prognostications of the evil that
might befall her for employing Leander. She spoke
more with the air of one who produces incidents to
prove an argument than of one who anticipates a
calamity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Leander, toothless and wretched, sitting on the
side of the wagon, began to show symptoms of joy
comparable to that of the vanguard of the Israelites,
catching their first glimpse of the Promised Land.
Touching Mary Carmichael on the shoulder, he
pointed to a white tent and the remains of a camp-fire.
Already Mrs. Yellett had begun to "Hallo,
Ben!" But Ben was at work at the vat, which was
still a quarter of a mile further up the mountain; so
Mrs. Yellett, throwing the reins to Leander and
bidding him turn out the horses, lost no time in
building a fire, putting on coffee, and making her
little party comfortable. So various was her efficiency
that she seemed no less at home in these
simple domestic tasks than when guiding her horses,
goddess-like, through the cloud-burst. And Mary
Carmichael, succumbing gradually to the revivifying
influence of the fire and the hot coffee, acknowledged
honestly to herself a warmth of affection for her
<span class="tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span>
<a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hostess and for the atmosphere Mrs. Yellett created
about her that made even Virginia and her aunts
seem less the only pivot of rational existence. She
felt that she had come West with but one eye, as it
were, and countless prejudices, whereas her powers
of vision were fast becoming increased a hundredfold.
How very tame life must be, she reflected,
as she sat smiling to herself, to those who did not
know Mrs. Yellett, how over-serious to those who
did not know Leander! Yet, after all, she knew
that the real basis of her readjusted vision was her
brief but illuminating acquaintance with Judith
Rodney. To Mary, freed for the first time in her
life from the most elegantly provincial of surroundings,
Judith seemed the incarnation of all the
splendor and heroism of the West. And in the
glow of her enthusiasm she decided then and there
not to abandon the Yellett educational problem till
she should have solved it successfully. She might
not be born to valiant achievement, like these
sturdy folk about her, but she might as well prove
to them that an Eastern tenderfoot was not all
feebleness and inefficiency.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Leander!" called Mrs. Yellett. "Just act as if
you was to home and wash up these dishes."</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">Foreshadowed</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">Alida awoke, knowing what was to happen.
She had dreamed of it, just before daylight,
and lay in bed stupefied by the horror of it, living,
again and again, through each frightful detail. It
had happened—there, in the very room, and before
the children; the noise of it had startled them; and
then she woke and knew she had been dreaming.
In the dream the noise had wakened the children—when
it really happened they must never know.
It wouldn&#39;t be fair to them; they needed a "clean
start."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">What had she done to keep them quiet? There
had been a thunderous knocking at the door. She
had expected it and was prepared; because the lock
was feeble, she had shoved the old brown bureau
against the door.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Nothing had happened. What a fool she was to
lie there and think of it! There was the brown
bureau against the wall; she could hear the deep
breathing of Jim in the room beyond. Jim had
been unequal to the task of conventionally going
to bed the night before, and she had put a pillow
under his head and a quilt over him. She was the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span>
<a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
last woman in the world to worry about Jim, drunk,
or to nag him for it when sober. But she didn&#39;t like
the children to see him that way.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">What was it that she had done to quiet the children
when "they" rode up? She had done something
and they had gone to sleep again, and she—and she—oh
no, it hadn&#39;t happened. What a fool she was
to lie there thinking! There were the children to
rouse and dress, and breakfast to cook, and Jim—Jim
would be feeling pretty mean this morning;
he&#39;d like a good cup of coffee. She was glad he was
alive to make coffee for.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She got up and, in the uncertainty bred of the
dream, felt the brown bureau, felt it hungrily, almost
incredulously. The brown bureau had been pushed
against the door when they had come, and knocked
and knocked. Then they had thundered with the
butts of their six-shooters, and the children had
wakened, and she had called out to them:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Sh-sh! It&#39;s only a bad dream. Mammy will
give you some dough to bake to-morrow."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And she had gone to press her face flat to the
thin wall, and call, "For God&#39;s sake, don&#39;t wake the
children!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And they had called out, "Let him come out
quiet, then."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And then she could feel that they put their
shoulders to the door—the weather-beaten door—with
its crazy lock that didn&#39;t half catch. The
brown bureau had spun across the floor like a top,
and they had crowded in. Then she had done
something to quiet the children—it was queer that
<span class="tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span>
<a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
she could not remember what it was, when everything
else in the dream still lived within her, horribly
distinct and real.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">What a fool she was, with Jim asleep in the next
room; she would not think about it another minute.
She began to dress, but her fingers were heavy,
and the vague oppression of nightmare blocked her
efficiency. Repeatedly she would detect herself subconsciously
brooding over some one of the links in
that pitiless memory—what they had said to Jim;
his undaunted replies; how she had left him and
gone into the next room because Jim had told her to.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She called the children, but the sight of them,
happy and flushed with sleep, did not reassure her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Mammy," said Topeka, eldest of the family, and
lately on the invalid list, the victim of a cactus
thorn, "my toe&#39;s all well; can I go barefoot?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Topeka Rodney, what kind of feet do you
expect to have when you are a young lady, if you
run barefoot now?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Topeka, sitting on the side of the bed, with tousled
hair, put her small feet together and contemplated
them. The toe was still suspiciously inflamed for
perfect convalescence, although Topeka, with a
Spartan courage that won her a place in the annals
of household valor, had the day before allowed
her mother to pick out with a needle the torturing
cactus thorn, scorning to shed a tear during the
operation, though afterwards she had taken the
piece of dried apple that was offered her and devoured
it to the last bite, as only just compensation
for her sufferings.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span>
<a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Dimmy dot a tore toe, too." But Jimmy
showed a strange reticence about offering proofs of
his affliction. At the peril of his equilibrium, he
clasped the allegedly injured member in his chubby
hand and rolled over on the bed in apparent
anguish.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Less see, Jimmy," asked his mother, anxiously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t bleeve him, mammy. He &#39;ain&#39;t ever cried.
He&#39;d a cried, for sure, if his toe was sore." At the
age of five, little Judith, namesake of her aunt, was
something of a doubting Thomas.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Let mammy see, Jimmy," and Alida bent over
her son and heir.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Doth Dimmy det any apple?" The wee man
sometimes succeeded in making terms with his
mother, when the other children were not present.
Though feeling himself a trifle over-confident, he
held the disputed toe with the air of one keeping
back a trump card, and looked his mother squarely
in the eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She struggled with the temptation to give him
the apple. He had lifted the horrors of her dream
as nothing else could have done, but she answered
him with quiet firmness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Jimmy must not tell stories."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Less see," insisted Topeka.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He dassent," affirmed Judith, junior, of little
faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It hurths me," and Jimmy tried to squeeze out a
tear. "It hurths me, my tore toe!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His mother tipped him over on his fat little back
and opened the chubby hand that held the trump
<span class="tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span>
<a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
toe. It was white from the pressure applied by the
infant dissembler, but there was no trace of the
treacherous cactus thorn. She gave him an affectionate
spank and went into the kitchen to make
coffee.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I with I had a tore toe," he crooned, quite unabashed
at the discovery of his deception. "I with
I toud det a tore toe &#39;thout the hurt."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But the horror of the dream gripped her when
she found herself alone in the kitchen; and she
remembered she had not told the children not to
go into the room where their father was sleeping.
She went back and found that Jimmy had not left
his post on the side of the bed, where he still regretted
that his perfectly well toe did not entitle him to
gastronomic consideration. Topeka, who had arrived
at an age where little girls, in the first subconscious
attempt at adornment, know no keener
delight than plastering their heads with a wet hairbrush,
till they present an appearance of slippery
rotundity equalled only by a peeled onion, put
down the brush with guilty haste at sight of her
mother.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;m goin&#39; to dress him soon as I&#39;ve done my
hair."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Any one think you was goin&#39; to be married, the
time you&#39;ve took to it."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It&#39;s gettin&#39; so long," urged Topeka.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I wouldn&#39;t give it a chance to grow no longer
while Jimmy was waitin&#39; to get dressed. And don&#39;t
go into the front room. Your father&#39;s gettin&#39; his
sleep out."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span>
<a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Topeka opened her round eyes. There was always
something suspicious about that sleep her
father had to get out, but she felt it was something
she must not ask questions about. Her mother
lingered; she dreaded to be alone in the kitchen.
The little, familiar intimacies between herself and
her children scattered the horrors of the dream
which would come back to her when she was again
at the mercy of her thoughts.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Judy, s&#39;pose you dress Jimmy this morning! I
want Topeka to help me get breakfast."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yessum," said Judith, dutifully. "Is he to have
his face washed?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He certainly is, Judy. I&#39;s ashamed to have you
ask such a question. &#39;Ain&#39;t you all been brought up
to have your faces washed?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But young Judith seemed disinclined to take up
this phase of family superiority. She merely inquired
further:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Is he to have it washed with soap, maw?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He shore is. Any one would think you had been
born and raised in Arizony or Nebrasky, to hear
you talk. I&#39;m plumb ashamed of you, Judy."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But, &#39;deed, maw, I ain&#39;t big enough to wash
his face with soap. It takes Topeka to hold his
head."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The subject of the discussion still sat on the edge
of the bed, a small lord of creation, letting his women
folk arrange among themselves who should minister
to his wants. As an instrument of torture the washcloth,
in the hands of his sister Judy, was no ignoble
rival of the cactus thorn. The question of making
<span class="tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span>
<a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
terms for his sufferings again appealed to him in the
light of a feasible business proposition.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Muvvy, tan&#39;t I have the apple? Judy hurts me
a lot when she wathes my face wis soap."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, you can have the apple, honey; and, Judy,
you be gentle with him. Don&#39;t rub his features up,
and be careful and don&#39;t get soap in his eyes."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No&#39;m." And Judy heroically stifled the longing
to slick her hair, like Topeka&#39;s, with the wet hairbrush.
There were easier tasks than washing the
face of her younger brother.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When Topeka and her mother were alone in the
kitchen, Topeka grinding the coffee and all unconsciously
working her jaw in an accompaniment to
the coffee-mill, her mother bent over her and said:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Did you dream of anything last night?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Topeka simultaneously stopped working the coffee-mill
and her jaw, and regarded her mother solemnly.
She did not remember having been thus questioned
about her dreams before.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No&#39;m," she answered, after laborious consideration.
But something in her mother&#39;s face held her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You&#39;re sure you didn&#39;t dream nothing?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, maw."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Did Judy or Jim say that they dreamed anything?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Jim said he dreamed he had a pup."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Was that all? Think hard, Topeka!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Topeka held the handle of the coffee-mill in her
hand; her jaw continued to work with the labor of
her mental process. "I&#39;ve thought hard, maw, and
all he told was about the pup."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span>
<a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Alida went back to her bedroom and again felt
the brown bureau. "What&#39;s the matter with me,
anyhow? It&#39;s the lonesomeness, and they bein&#39; agin
Jim the way they are. God, this country&#39;s hard on
women and horses!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When breakfast was over, and young Jim had
received the reward of his valor in presenting a
brave face to his ablution, and Judith the reward
of her skill, the evidence of which almost prevented
the young martyr from smiling while he enjoyed his
treat, their mother sent them all to play in the
cañon. She told them not to come home till she
should come for them, and if any one should ask
about their father, to say that he was away from
home. And this, as well as the mystery of her
father&#39;s "getting his sleep out," roused some slight
apprehension in Topeka, who was old for her age.
They were seldom sent to the cañon to play. Topeka
looked at her mother as she had when questioned
about the dream, but there was no further confidence
between them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You do as your sister Topeka tells you, and
remember what I said about your papa," Alida said
to the younger children. Jim and Judy clasped each
other&#39;s hands in mute compact at the edict. Their
sister Topeka had a real genius for authority; they
were minded all too well when she swayed the
maternal sceptre vicariously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Alida made fresh coffee for Jim when the children
had gone. She made it carefully; there was this
morning, unconsciously, about each little thing that
<span class="tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span>
<a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
she did for him, the solemnity of a funeral rite.
Struggle as she would, she could not divest her
mind of the conviction that what she did this day
she did for the dead. She would go to the door and
listen to his breathing, and tell herself that she was a
fool, then wring her hands at the remembrance of
the dream.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As he tossed, half waking, she heard him groan
and curse the cattle-men with oaths that made her
glad she had sent the children from home. Then
she bent over him and woke him from his uneasy
slumber.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Jim, don&#39;t you want me to bathe your head?
And here&#39;s some nice, hot coffee all ready for you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Jim woke slowly to a realization of his troubles
and his blessings. His wife was bathing his head
with hands that trembled. Not always had she
greeted his indiscretions with such loving forbearance.
He noticed, though his waking faculties were
not over-keen, that her face was pale and frightened,
and that her eyes, meeting his, held a dumb,
measureless affection.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What th&#39; hell are you babying me for?" But
his roughness did not deceive her woman&#39;s wits.
He was not getting the lecture he anticipated, and
this was his way of showing that he was not embarrassed
by her kindness. The morning sunlight
was pitilessly frank in its exposure of the grim pinch
of poverty in the mean little room, but the woman
was unconscious of these things; what she saw was
that Jim, the reckless, Jim, the dare-devil terror of
the country, Jim, who had married and settled with
<span class="tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span>
<a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
her into home-keeping respectability, Jim, who had
struggled with misfortune and fallen, had, young as
he was, lost every look of youth; that hope had gone
from his dull eyes, and that his face had become
drawn until the death&#39;s-head grinned beneath the
scant padding of flesh. But he was to-day, as
always, the one man in the world for her. In
making a world of their own and reducing their
parents to supplementary consideration, their children,
whom she had sent away that she might be
alone with him, had given a different quality to the
love of this pair that had known so many curious
vicissitudes. The responsibilities of parenthood
had placed them on a tenderer, as well as a securer
footing; and as she saw his age and weariness,
he recognized hers, and both felt a self-accusing
twinge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s a blamed good cup of coffee," he said,
by way of relieving the tension that had crept into
the situation. "Any one would think you was settin&#39;
your cap for me &#39;stead of us being married for
years."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Alida sighed. "It&#39;s better to end than to begin
like this," she said, in the far-away voice of one who
thinks aloud. The word "end" had slipped out
before she realized what she was saying, and the
knowledge haunted her as an omen. She glanced
at him quickly, to see if he had noticed it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Why did you say end?" He saw that her eyes
were full of tears and chafed her. "You ain&#39;t
thinking of divorcing me, like Mountain Pink done
Bosky?"</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span>
<a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, Jim," she said, and her face was all
aquiver, "I never could divorce you, no matter what
you done." And then the grim philosophy of the
plains-woman asserted itself. "I never can understand
why women feed their pride on their
heart&#39;s blood; it never was my way."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He did not like to remember that he had given
her cause for a way. "There&#39;s a lot of women
as wouldn&#39;t exactly regard me as a Merino, or a
Southdown, either;" he gulped the coffee to ease
the tightness in his throat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"They&#39;d be women of no judgment, then," she
said, with conviction.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Jim&#39;s head was tilted back, resting in the palm
of his hand. His profile, sharpened by anxiety,
more than suggested his quarter-strain of Sioux
blood. He might almost have been old Chief
Flying Hawk himself, as he looked steadily at the
woman who had been a young girl and reckless,
when he had been a boy and reckless; who had
paid her woman&#39;s penalty and come into her woman&#39;s
kingdom; who had made a man of him by the
mystery of her motherhood, and who had uncomplainingly
gone with him into the wilderness
and become an alien and an outcast.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">These things unmanned him as the sight of the
gallows and the rope for his hanging could not have
done. Shielding himself with an affected roughness,
he asked:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What the hell&#39;s the matter with you? I&#39;ve been
drinking like a beast of an Indian, and you give me
coffee instead of a tongue-lashing."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span>
<a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">The color had all gone out of her face. She
gasped the words:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Jim, I dreamed it last night—they came for
you!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She cowered at the recollection.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Did they get me?" he asked. There was no
surprise in his tone. He spoke as one who knew
the answer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, the children saw. The noise woke them."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You mustn&#39;t let &#39;em see, when—they come.
They&#39;ve a right to a fair start; we didn&#39;t get it, old
girl."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The children gave it to us," and she faced him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, yes, but we want them to have it from the
start, like good folks."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They looked into each other&#39;s eyes. The memory
of dead and gone madness twinkled there a moment,
then each remembered:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You must hurry, Jim. You haven&#39;t a moment
to lose. I dreamed it was to be to-night—they&#39;ll
come to-night!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The game&#39;s all up, old girl! If I had a month I
couldn&#39;t get away. Morrison&#39;s been looking for me
over to the Owl Creek Range; he&#39;s back—Stevens
told me yesterday. He&#39;ll be heading here soon.
The price on my head is a strain on friendship."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Have the sheep-men gone back on you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Yes, damn them! A thousand dollars is big
money, and they&#39;ve had hard luck!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"They deserve it; I hope every herd in the State
dies of scab."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There wasn&#39;t a scabby sheep in our bunch.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span>
<a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
What a sight they were, loaded with tallow! There
wasn&#39;t one of them that couldn&#39;t have weathered
a blizzard; they could have lived on their own tallow
for a month."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She tried to divert his attention from his lost
flock. When he began to talk about them the
despair of his loss drove him to drink. She was
ground between the millstones of his going or staying.
If he stayed they would come for him; if he
went, they would apprehend him before he was ten
miles from the house.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Jim, we got to think. If there&#39;s a chance in a
thousand that you can get away, you got to take it;
if there ain&#39;t, the children mustn&#39;t know. We got
to think it out!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There ain&#39;t a chance in a thousand, old girl.
There ain&#39;t one in a million. They&#39;re circling round
in the hills out here now, waitin&#39; for me, like
buzzards waitin&#39; for the eyes of a dyin&#39; horse."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She rocked herself, and the clutching fingers left
white marks on her face, but the eyes that met his
glittered tearless:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then there ain&#39;t nothing left but to face it like a
man?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s all there be." He might have been giving
an opinion on a matter in which he had no interest.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Then there ain&#39;t no use in our having any more
talk about it?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Tain&#39;t just what you&#39;d call an agreeable subject,"
he answered, with the sinister humor of the
frontiersman who has learned to make a crony of
death.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span>
<a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">She was tempted to kiss him—they were not given
to demonstrations, this pair—then decided it were
kinder to him, less suggestive of what they anticipated,
not to deviate from their undemonstrative
marital routine.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Do you want your breakfast now?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I guess you might bring it along."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And for the same reason that she refrained from
kissing him, she repressed a desire to wring the neck
of a young broiler and cook it for his breakfast,
remembering that she had heard they gave folks
pretty much what they wanted when they wouldn&#39;t
want it long. So Jim got his usual breakfast of
bacon, uncooked canned tomatoes, soda-biscuit, and
coffee. She sat with him while he ate, but they spoke
no more of "them" or of how soon "they" might be
expected. She told him that young Jim had pretended
that morning that he had a cactus thorn in
his foot, so that he might have a piece of dried
apple. And old Jim, in an excess of parental
fondness and pride, said: "The damned little liar,
he&#39;ll get to Congress yet!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But the children were a dangerous topic for overstrained
nerves at this particular time, so Alida
told Jim that she had put the black hen to set and
she thought they&#39;d have some chickens at last.
Jim smoked while Alida washed the dishes, and when
Jim&#39;s back was turned she examined the lock on the
door—a good push would open it. Then she looked
at the brown bureau, and the recklessness of despair
came into her eyes. In the room beyond, Jim
was reading a two weeks&#39; old newspaper and smoking.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span>
<a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He looked like a lazy ranchman taking his
ease.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As she went about her household tasks that
morning, Alida noticed things as she had never
noticed them before. A sunbeam came through
the shutterless window of the house and writhed
and quivered on the wall as if it were a live thing.
She read a warning in this, and in the color of the
sun, that was red, like blood, and in the whirr of the
grasshoppers, that was sinister and threatening.
The creeks had dried, and their slimy beds crept
along the willows like sluggish snakes. Gaunt range-cattle
bellowed in their thirst, and the parched
earth crackled beneath the sun that hung above the
house like a flaming disk. Sometimes she sank
beneath the burden of it; then she would wring
her hands and call on God to help them; they were
beyond human power. She and Jim were alone all
the morning; they did not again refer to what they
knew would happen. He read his old paper and she
put her house in order. She did it with especial care.
It was meet to have things seemly in the house of
the dead. And every time she glanced at Jim
she repressed the desire to fling herself on his breast
and cry out the anguish that consumed her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At noon she brought the children home to dinner,
and afterwards Jim taught them to throw the lasso
and played buffalo with them. Alida did not trust
herself to watch them; she stayed in the kitchen
and saw the sunbeam grow pale with the waning
of the day, the day whose minutes dragged like
lead, yet had rushed from her, leaving her the night
<span class="tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span>
<a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to face. At sundown she cooked supper, but she no
longer knew what she did. A crazy agility had
taken possession of her and she spun about the
kitchen, doing the same errand many times, finding
herself doing always something different from that
she had set about doing. The molten day was
burning itself out like a fever; hot gusts of air beat
up from the earth, but the woman who waited
felt chilled to the marrow, and took a cloak down
from a peg and wrapped it about her while she
waited for the biscuit to bake. At supper they sat
down together, the man and his wife and their
three children. The children were in fine spirits
from the fun they had had that afternoon. Never
had daddy been so nice to them. He had taught
Topeka to throw the lasso so well that she had
caught the cat once and little Jim twice; and daddy
had played he was a buffalo and had charged them
all with his head down, till they screamed in terror.
But daddy seemed more quiet through the meal, and
once mother started up and cried:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What&#39;s that?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She ran to the door with her hand pressed to her
side, but daddy called after her:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Don&#39;t you know the cowards better than that?
They&#39;ll wait for nightfall."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But these things had not worried the children,
with their heads full of playing buffalo and throwing
the lariat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Jim," said his father, before they went to bed,
"remember you are the man of the family." But
young Jim was already nodding with sleep. Topeka
<span class="tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span>
<a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Judith were sleepy, too; they kissed their father
and were glad to go to bed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The night began menacingly to close over the
wilderness. Where the sun had hung above the
mountain a moment before there glowed a great
pool of red that dripped across the blackness in faint
tricklings. The outlines of the foot-hills loomed
huge, formless, uncouth. In the half-light it seemed
a world struggling in the birth-throes. All day
the dry, burning heat had quivered over the desert,
like hot-air waves flickering over a bed of live coals,
and now the very earth seemed to palpitate with the
intensity of its fever. The bellowing of the thirst-maddened
cattle had not stopped with the twilight
that brought no dew to slake their parched throats.
In the hills the coyotes wailed like lost souls. It
was night bereft of benisons, day made frightful by
darkness. All the heat of a cycle of desert summers
seemed concentrated in that house in the valley
where the man and his wife waited. Each sound of
the desert night Alida translated into the trampling
of horses&#39; feet; then, as the sound would die away,
or prove to be but some night noise of the wilderness,
the pallor would lose its pinch on her features, and
she would stare into her husband&#39;s face with eyes
that did not see. Jim smoked his pipe and refilled
it, smoked and filled again, but gave no sign of the
object of his waiting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Jim," she said, when the clock had struck ten,
then eleven, "I am going to fasten up the house."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Do you hear them?" he asked, without emotion,
but as one who deferred to the finer senses of women.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span>
<a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">She shook her head, not trusting herself to speak.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He looked at the door that was shrunken and
warped from the heat till it barely held together,
and there was no measure to the tenderness he put
into:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, you poor little fool, do you think you could
keep them out by fastening that?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Jim, I must," and her voice broke. "They may
think you are not here, that it&#39;s only me and the
children, and that&#39;s why the house is fastened."
She got up and began to move about as though
her thoughts scourged her to action, even if futile.
He shook the ashes from his pipe.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Do anything you blame please," he said, more
by way of humoring her than from faith in her stratagem.
He felt strong enough to face his destiny, to
meet it in a way worthy of his mother&#39;s people.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Alida seemed under a spell in her preparations
for the night. Each thing she did as she had done
it in her dream the night before; it was as if she
were constrained by a power greater than her will
to fulfil a sinister prophecy. Yet now and then
she would stop and wonder if she might not break
the spell by doing things differently from the way
she had dreamed them. Her hand grasped the
knob of the door uncertainly, and she swung it to
and fro on its creaking hinges, while her mind seemed
likewise to sway hither and thither. Should she
fasten the door and push the bureau against it, as it
had been in the dream, or should she leave door
and windows gaping wide for them? And then, as
one who walks and does familiar things in sleep,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span>
<a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
she shut the door and turned the key. Jim smiled
at her, but she could no longer look at him. One
of the children wailed fretfully from the room beyond.
Sleep had become a scourge in the stifling
heat. One by one she lowered the windows and
nailed them down; then she dragged the brown bureau
against the door, took the brace of six-shooters
from the wall, and sat down with Jim to wait.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What are you going to do with them toys?" he
asked, as he saw her examine the chambers of one
of the six-shooters.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You ain&#39;t going to let yourself be caught like
a rat in a hole, are you?" she reproached him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"&#39;Ain&#39;t we agreed that it&#39;s best to keep onpleasant
family matters from the kids?" He smiled at her
bravely. "The remembrance of what we&#39;re anticipatin&#39;
ain&#39;t going to help young Jim to get to
Congress when his time comes, nor it ain&#39;t going to
help the girls get good husbands, either. This here
country ain&#39;t what it was in the way of liberality
since it&#39;s got to be a State."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Sh-sh-sh!" she said. "Is that the range-cattle
stampedin&#39; after water, or is it—" They listened.
The furniture in the room crackled; there was not
a fibre of it to which the resistless heat had not
penetrated. On the range the cattle bellowed in
their thirst-torture; in the intervals of their cries
sounded something far off, but regular as the thumping
of a ship&#39;s screw. The woman did not need an
answer to her question. The steady trampling of
hoofs came muffled through the dead air, but the
sound was unmistakable. She put her arms about
<span class="tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span>
<a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the man&#39;s neck and crushed him to her with all her
woman strength. "Oh, Jim, you&#39;ve been a good
man to me!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Steady—steady." He strained her close to him.
"They&#39;d be, by the sound of them, on the straight
bit of road now, before the turn. Soon we&#39;ll hear
their hoofs ring hollow as they cross the plank
bridge."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His plainsman&#39;s faculty was as keen as ever;
his calculation of the horsemen&#39;s distance was made
as though he were the least concerned. All Alida&#39;s
courage had gone, with the dread thing at hand.
She clung to him, dazed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"They&#39;re sober, all right enough."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How do you know?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"They&#39;d be cursing and bellowing if they were
drunk."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The hoofs rang hollow on the little plank bridge
that crossed the ditch about a stone&#39;s-throw from
the door. Not a word was said either within or
without. The lynchers seemed to have drilled for
their part; there was no whispering, no deferring
to a leader. On they came, so close that Jim and
Alida could hear the creaking of their saddles.
There was the clank of spurs and the straining of
leather as they dismounted, then some one knocked
at the door till the warped boards rattled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Jim could feel the thudding of Alida&#39;s heart as
she clung to him, but when the knock was repeated
a new courage came to her, and she left Jim and
went on her knees close to the outer wall.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Jim, is that you?" she called, and now every
<span class="tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span>
<a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sense was trained to battle; her voice had even a
sleepy cadence, as if she had been suddenly roused.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That won&#39;t do at all, Miz Rodney. We know
you got Jim in there, just as certain as we&#39;re out
here, and we want him to come out and we&#39;ll do the
thing square, otherwise he can take the consequences."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Jim opened his mouth to speak, but she, still on
her knees beside the wall, gained his silence by one
supplicating gesture. There was a sleepy, fretful
cry from the room beyond—the noise had roused
one of the children.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Sh-sh, dear," she called. "It&#39;s only a bad
dream. Go to sleep again; mother is here."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Through the warped door came sounds of the
whispering voices without, drowned by the shrieking
bellow of the cattle. There was not a breath
of air in the suffocating room. Jim bent towards
Alida:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;m goin out to &#39;em. They&#39;ll do it square, over
on the cotton-woods; this rumpus&#39;ll only wake the
kids."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But she shook her head imploringly, putting her
finger to her lips as a sign that he was not to speak,
and he had not the heart to refuse, though knowing
that she made a desperate situation worse.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Gentlemen"—she spoke in a low, distinct voice—"Jim
ain&#39;t here. He&#39;s been away from home five
days. There&#39;s no one here but me and the children;
you&#39;ve woke them up and frightened them by
pounding on the door. I ask you to go away."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"If he ain&#39;t in there, will you let us search the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span>
<a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
house?" It was Henderson that spoke, Henderson,
foreman of the "XXX" outfit.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I can&#39;t have them frightened; please take my
word and go away."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Whas er matter, muvvy?" called Judith, sleepily.
Young Jim was by this time crying lustily. Only
Topeka said nothing. With the precocity of a
frontier child, she half realized the truth. She tried
to comfort little Jim, though her teeth chattered in
fear and she felt cold in the hot, still room. Then
Judith called out, "Make papa send them away."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Your papa ain&#39;t here, Judith." But the fight
had all gone out of Alida&#39;s voice; it was the groan
of an animal in a trap.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Where&#39;s papa gone to?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Sh-sh, Judith! Topeka, keep your sister quiet."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was absolutely still, within and without, for a
full minute. Then Alida heard the shoving of
shoulders against the door. Once, twice, thrice the
lock resisted them. The brown bureau spun across
the room like a child&#39;s toy. The lynchers, bursting
in, saw Alida with her arms around Jim. When the
last hope had gone it was instinct with her to protect
him with her own body.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Go into the kids, old girl, this is no place for you."
And there was that in his voice that made her obey.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Something of the glory of old Chief Flying Hawk,
riding to battle, was in the face of his grandson.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Remember, the children ain&#39;t to know," he said
to his wife; and to the lynchers, "Gentlemen, I&#39;m
ready."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Alida heard the mingled sounds of footsteps
and hoofs grow fainter on the trail. The
children looked at her to tell them why this night
was different from all others—what was happening.
But she could only cower among them, more terrified
than they. She seemed to be shrunken from the
happenings of that day. They hardly knew the
little, shrivelled, gray woman who looked at them
with unfamiliar eyes. Alida gazed at the little
Judith, and there was something in her mother&#39;s
glance that made the little one hide her face in her
sister&#39;s shoulder. Young Judith it was who all unwittingly
had told the lynchers that her father was
at home, and in Alida&#39;s heart there was towards this
child a blind, unreasoning hate. Better had she
never been born than live to do this thing!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was the wee man, Jim, who first began to
reflect resentfully on this intrusion on his slumbers.
He had been sleeping well and comfortably when
some grown-ups came with a lot of noise, and his
father had gone away with them. It had frightened
him, but his mother was here, and why should she
not put him to sleep again?</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span>
<a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Muvvy, sing &#39;Dway Wolf.&#39;" And as she paid
no heed, but looked at him, white-faced and strange,
he again repeated, with his most insinuating and
beguiling tricks of eye and smile:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Muvvy, sing &#39;Dway Wolf&#39; for Dimmy."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The child put his head in his mother&#39;s lap, and
Alida began, scarce knowing what she did:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">"&#39;The gray wolves are coming fast over the hill,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8em" class="tei tei-l">Run fast, little lamb, do not baa, do not bleat,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">For the gray wolves are hungry, they come here to kill,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8em" class="tei tei-l">And the lambs shall be scattered—&#39;</p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">"No, no, Jimmy, muvvy cannot sing. Oh, can&#39;t you
feel, child? Judith, Judith, why were you ever born?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was still in the valley. Had they come to the
dead cotton-woods yet? Had they begun it? The
children shrank from this gray-faced woman whom
they did not know and but yet a little while had
been their mother. An awful silence had fallen on
the night. The range-cattle no longer bellowed in
their thirst; the hot wind no longer blew from the
desert. A hush not of earth nor air nor the things
that were of her ken seemed to have fallen about
them, muffing the dark loneliness as by invisible
flakes. The children had crouched close together for
comfort. They feared the little, gray-faced woman
who seemed to have stolen into their mother&#39;s place
and looked at them with strange eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Jimmy looked at the woman who held him, hoping
his mother would come, and he could see them both.
And while he waited he dropped off to sleep; and
little Judith, hiding her head on Topeka&#39;s shoulder,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span>
<a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that she might not see the look in those accusing
eyes, presently dreamed that all was well with her
again; and Topeka reflected that if her mother
should ask her in the morning whether she had
dreamed last night, she would have a fine tale to
tell of men riding up, and loud voices, and trying
of the door, and father going away with them.
Her mother had questioned her this morning when
nothing had happened to warrant it. Surely she
would ask again to-morrow, and Topeka could tell—she
could tell—all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Alida looked at her three sleeping children—his
children, and yet they could sleep. Into her mind
came that cry of utter desolation, "Could ye not
watch with me one hour?" And God had been
deaf to Him, His son, even as He was deaf to her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The children were sleeping easily. The hush that
had hung like a pall over the valley had not lifted.
Had they done it? Was it over yet? She went to
the door and listened. Surely the silence that
wrapped the valley was a thing apart. It was as no
other silence that she could remember. It was still,
still, and yet there was vibration to it, like the
muffled roar within a shell. She strained her ears—was
that the sound of horsemen going down the
trail? No, no, it was only the beating of her foolish
heart that would not be still, but beat and fluttered
and would not let her hear. Yes, surely, that was
the sound of hoofs. It was over then—they were
going.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She would go and look for him. Perhaps it would
not be too late—she had heard of such things.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span>
<a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
A dynamic force consumed her. She had no consciousness
of her body. Her feet and hands did
things with incredible swiftness—lighted a lantern,
selected a knife, ran to the corral for an old ladder
that had been there when they took possession of
the deserted house; and through all her frantic
haste she could feel this new force, as it were, lick
up the red blood in her veins, burn her body to
ashes as it gave her new power. She felt that
never again would she have need of meat and
drink and sleep. This force would abide with her
till all was over, then leave her, like the whitened
bones of the desert.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was dark in the valley, but the menacing
stillness seemed to be lifting. The range-cattle
had again taken up their plaint, the sounds of the
desert night swept across the stony walls of the
cañon. Alida knew that it must have happened
at the dead cotton-woods. There were no other
high trees about for miles. Again she listened before
advancing. There was no sound of hoof or
champing bit or men moving quickly. They had
gone their way into the valley. She ran swiftly, her
lantern throwing its beam across the scrubby inequalities
of ground, but for her there was no need
of its beacon. To-night she was beyond the halting,
stumbling uncertainties of tread to which man is
subject. There was magic in her feet and in her
hands and brain. Like the wind she ran, the wind
on the great plain where there are no foot-hills to
hinder its course. The black, dead trees stood out
distinctly against the starry sky, and from a cross-limb
<span class="tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span>
<a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of one of them dangled something with head
awry, like a broken jumping-jack, something that
had once been a man—and her husband. She could
touch the feet of this frightful thing and feel its
human warmth. A wind came up from the desert
and blew across the cañon&#39;s rocky walls into the
valley, and the parody of a man swayed to it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She had been expecting this thing. For weeks
the image of it had been graven on her heart.
Sleeping or waking, she had seen nothing but his
dangling body from the cross-limb. Yet with the
actual consummation before her, she felt its hideous
novelty as though it were unexpected. At sight of
it the force that had borne her up through the
happenings of that day went out of her, and as
she stood with the knife and the rope, that she
had brought in the hope of cheating the lynchers,
dangling from her nerveless hand her helplessness
overcame her. Again and again she called to the
dead man for help, called to him as she had been
accustomed to call when her woman&#39;s strength had
been unequal to some heavy household task.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Far down the trail she could hear the gallop of a
horse coming closer, and mingled with the sounds of
its flying feet was a voice urging the horse to greater
speed in the shrill cabalistic "Hi-hi-hi-ki!" of the
plains-man. What was it—one of them returning
to see that she did not cheat the rope of its due?—to
hang her beside him, as an after-thought, as they
hanged Kate Watson beside her man? Let them.
She was standing near the swaying thing when horse
and rider gained the ground beside her, and what
<span class="tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span>
<a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was left to her of consciousness made out that the
rider was Judith. She pointed to it, and stood
helpless with the dangling rope in her hand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Are we too late?" Judith almost whispered, as
she caught Alida&#39;s cold, inert hands. "I dreamed
it all and came. If I could have dreamed it sooner!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Alida did not seem to hear, neither could she
speak. She only pointed again to the thing beside
her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith understood. The women had a task to
share, and in silence they began it. The lynchers
had done their work all too well. Again and again
the women strove with all their strength to take
down the dangling parody of a man, which in its
dead-weight resistance seemed in league with the
forces against them. At last the thing was done.
Down to a pale world, that in the haggard gray of
morning seemed to bear in its countenance something
of the pinch of death, Judith lowered the
thing that had so lately been a man. She cut the
rope away from the neck, she straightened the wry
neck that seemed to wag in pantomimic representation
of the last word to the lynchers. They&#39;d have
to reckon with him on dark nights, and when the
wind wailed like a famished wolf and when things
not to be explained lurked in the shadows of the
desert.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The morning stillness came flooding into the
cup-shaped valley like a soft, resistless wave. Something
had come to the gray, old earth—another day,
with all its human gift of joy and woe, and the
earth welcomed it though it had known so many.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span>
<a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The sun burst through the gold-tipped aureole of
cloud, scattering far and wide lavish promises of a
perfect day. The earth seemed to respond with a
thrill. No longer was the pinch of death in her
countenance. The valley, the mountains, the invisible
wind, even the dead cotton-woods, seemed
endowed with throbbing life that contrasted fearsomely
with the terrible nullity of this thing that
once had been Jim Rodney.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Alida had ceased to take any part in the hideous
drama. She sat on the ground, a crouching thing
with glittering eyes. It was past comprehension
that the sun could shine and the world go on with
her man dead before her. Judith had become the
force that planned and did to save the family pride.
While her hands were busy with preparations for
the dead, she rehearsed what she would say to this
and that one to account for Jim&#39;s absence. The
silence of the men who had done this thing would
be as steadfast as their own.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And there were the children. Through all her
frantic search for things in the house, Judith remembered
that she must step softly and not waken
the children. With each turn of the screw, as her
numbed consciousness rallied and responded afresh
to the hideous realization of this thing, there came
no release from the tyrannous hold of petty detail.
She remembered that she must be back at noon to
hold post-office, and there would be the endless
comedy to be played once more with her cavaliers.
They must never suspect from word or look of hers.
And there was the dance to-night at the Benton
<span class="tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span>
<a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ranch—she hid her face in her hands. Ah, no, she
could not do this thing! And yet they must not
suspect. She must contrive to give the impression
that Jim had cheated the rope. Yes, she must
go and dance, and, if need be, dance with his very
murderers. Jim&#39;s children were to have the "clean
start" that he intended, and they would have to
get it here. There was no money for an exodus and
a beginning elsewhere.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Alida still crouched beside the long, even tarpaulin
roll that Judith had prepared with hands
that knew not what they did. But now Judith
gently roused her and put in her hand a spade;
already she herself had begun. But Alida stared
at it dully, as if she did not understand. Then
Judith pointed to something black that had begun
to wheel in the sky, wheel, and with each circular
swoop come closer to the roll of tarpaulin. Then
Alida knew, and, taking the spade, she and Judith
began to dig the grave.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 85%" class="tei tei-head">The Ball</h1>

<p class="tei tei-p">The dance in the Benton ranch was the great
social event of the midsummer season. The
Bentons had begun to give dances in the days of
plenty, when the cattle industry had been at its
dizziest height; and they had continued to give
dances through all the depressing fluctuations of
the trade, perhaps in much the same spirit as one
whistles in the dark to keep up his courage. Thus,
though cattle fell and continued to fall in the
scale of prices till the end no man dared surmise,
the Benton "boys"—they were two brothers, aged
respectively forty-five and fifty years—continued
to hold out facilities to dance and be merry.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">All day strange wagons—ludicrous, makeshift
things—had been discharging loads of women and
children at the Benton ranch, tired mothers and
their insistent offspring. To the women this strenuous
relaxation came as manna in the wilderness.
What was the dreary round of washing, ironing,
baking, and the chain of household tasks that
must be done as primitively as in Genesis, if only
they might dance and forget? So the mothers came
early and stayed late, and the primary sessions of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span>
<a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the dances fulfilled all the functions of the latter-day
mothers&#39; congresses—there were infant ailments
to be discussed, there were the questions of food
and of teething, of paregoric and of flannel bands,
which, strange heresy, seemed to be "going out,"
according to the latest advices from those compendiums
of all domestic information, the "Woman&#39;s
Pages" of the daily papers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Inasmuch as these more than punctual debaters
must be cooked for, there was, to speak plainly,
"feeling" on the part of the housekeeper at the
Bentons&#39;. Wasn&#39;t it enough for folks to come to a
dance and get a good supper, and go away like
Christians when the thing was over, instead of
coming a day before it began and lingering on as
if they had no home to go to? This, at least, was
the housekeeper&#39;s point of view, a crochety one,
be it said, not shared by the brothers Benton,
whose hospitality was as genuine as it was primitive.
To this same difficult lady the infants, who were
too tender in years to be separated from their
mothers, were as productive of anxiety as their
elders. A room had been set apart for their especial
accommodation, the floor of which, carefully spread
with bed-quilts and pillows, prevented any great
damage from happening to the more tender of the
guests; and they rolled and crooned and dug their
small fists into each other&#39;s faces while their mothers
danced in the room beyond.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">By nightfall the Benton ranch gleamed on the
dark prairie like a constellation. Lights burned at
every window; a broad beam issued from the door
<span class="tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span>
<a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and threw a welcoming beacon across the darkness
and silence of the night. The scraping of fiddles
mingled with the rhythmic scuffle of feet and the
singsong of the words that the dancers sung as they
whirled through the figures of the quadrille and
lancers. About the walls of the room where the
dancing was in progress stood a fringe of gallants,
their heads newly oiled, and proclaiming the fact
in a bewildering variety of strong perfumes. Red
silk neckerchiefs knotted with elaborate carelessness
displayed to advantage bronzed throats; new overalls,
and of the shaggiest species, amply testified to
the social importance of the Benton dance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As yet the dancing was but intermittent and was
engaged in chiefly by the mothers with large progeny,
who felt that after the arrival of a greater number
of guests, and among them the unmarried girls, their
opportunities might not be as plentiful as at present.
One or two cow-punchers, in an excess of civility
at the presence of the fair, had insisted on giving
up their six-shooters, mumbling something about
"there being ladies present and a man being hasty
at times." In the "bunk-room," which did duty
as a gentleman&#39;s cloak-room, things were really
warming up. There was much drinking of healths,
as the brothers Benton had thoughtfully provided
the wherewithal, and that in excellent quality.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Costigan was there, and Texas Tyler, who had
ridden sixty miles to "swing a petticoat," or, if there
were not enough to go round, to dance with a
handkerchief tied to some fellow&#39;s sleeve. By
"swinging a petticoat" it was perfectly understood
<span class="tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span>
<a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
among all his friends that he meant a chance to
dance with Judith Rodney. Year in and year out
Texas never failed to present himself at the post-office
on mail-days, if his work took him within a
radius of fifty miles of the Daxes. No dance where
the possibility of seeing Judith was even remote was
too long a ride for him to undertake, even when it
took him across the dreariest wastes of the desert.
Texas had been devoted to Judith since she had
left the convent, and sometimes, perhaps twice a
year, she told him that she valued his friendship.
On all other occasions she rejected his suit as if his
continual pressing of it were something in the nature
of an affront. Yet Texas persevered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, here&#39;s lukin&#39; at you, since in the way of a
frind there&#39;s nothing better to look at!" and Costigan
drained a tin cup at Texas Tyler.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Your very good health," said Texas, who was
somewhat embarrassed by what was regarded as
Costigan&#39;s "floweriness."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Begorra, is that Hinderson or the ghost av the
b&#39;y?" Costigan&#39;s roving eye was arrested by the
foreman of the "XXX," who stood drinking with
two or three men of his outfit. He was pale and
ill-looking. He drank several times in succession,
as if he needed the stimulant, and without the
formality of drinking to any one. The two or three
"XXX" men who were with him seemed to be
equally in need of restoratives.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">They talked of the cattle stampede in which
several of the outfits had been heavy losers. Some
nine hundred head of cattle had been recovered, and
<span class="tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span>
<a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
members of the different outfits were still scouring
the Red Desert for strays.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Something in the nature of a sensation was created
by the arrival of the Wetmore party. The
women were frankly interested in the clothes, bearing,
and general deportment of the New-Yorkers.
Rumors of Miss Colebrooke&#39;s beauty were rife, and
there was a general inclination to compare her with
local belles. Such exotic types—they had seen
these city beauties before—were as a rule too colorless
for their appreciation. They liked faces that
had "more go to them," was the verdict passed upon
one famous beauty who had visited the Wetmores
the year before. In arrangement of the hair, perhaps,
in matters of dress, the judges were willing
to concede the laurels to city damsels, but there
concession stopped. But evidently Kitty, to judge
from the elaboration of her toilet, did not intend
to be dismissed thus cursorily. She herself was
delicately, palely pretty, as always, but her hair
was tortured to a fashionable fluffiness, and the
simplicity of her green muslin gown was only in
the name. It was muslin disguised, elaborated,
beribboned, lace-trimmed till its identity was all
but lost in the multitude of pretty complications.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Did you know that old Ma&#39;am Yellett had a
school-marm up to her place?" asked one of the
men, apropos of Eastern prettiness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Well, well," Costigan reminisced, "&#39;tis some av
thim Yillitt lambs thot&#39;s six fut in their shtockings,
if Oi be rimimbering right. Sure, the tacher ought
to be something av a pugilist, Oi&#39;m thinkin&#39;."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span>
<a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I seen her the other day, and a neater little
heifer never turned out to pasture. Lord, I&#39;d like
to be gnawing the corners of the primer right now,
if she was there to whale the ruler."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Arrah," bayed Costigan, "but the women question
is gittin&#39; complicated ontoirely, wid Miss
Rodney—an&#39; herself lukin&#39; loike a saint in a church
window—dalin&#39; the mails an&#39; th&#39; other wan tachin&#39;
in the mountains. Sure, this place is gittin&#39; to be
but a sorry shpot for bachelors loike mesilf."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I ain&#39;t mentionin&#39; no names, but there&#39;s a man
here ain&#39;t treatin&#39; a mighty fine woman square and
accordin&#39; to the way she ought to be treated."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The information ran through the circle like an
electric shock. Men stopped in the act of pledging
each other&#39;s healths to listen. Loungers straightened
up; every topic was dropped. The man who
had made the statement was the loose-lipped busybody
who had suggested to his host that he give up
his six-shooter since there were "ladies present."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What the hell are you waiting for?" queried
Texas Tyler, savagely. "You&#39;ve cracked your whip,
made your bow, and got our attention; why the hell
don&#39;t you go on?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The man looked about nervously. He was rather
alarmed at the interest he had excited. The next
moment Peter Hamilton had walked into the room.
There was something crucial in his entrance at this
particular time; it crystallized suspicion. The gossip
took advantage of the greetings to Hamilton to make
his escape. Texas Tyler left the bunk-room immediately
and looked for him in the room with the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span>
<a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dancers. The fiddles, in the hands of a couple of
Mexicans, had set the whole room whirling as if
by magic. As they danced they sang, joining with
the "caller-out," who held his vociferous post between
the rooms, till the room was full of singing,
dancing men and women, who spun and pirouetted
as if they had not a care in the world. But Texas
Tyler was not of these, as he looked through the
dancers for his man. There was a red flash in the
pupils of his eyes, and he told himself that he was
going to do things the way they did them in Texas,
for, of course, he knew that the loose-lipped idiot
had meant Judith Rodney and Peter Hamilton.
Never before had such an idea occurred to him,
and now that it had been presented to his mind&#39;s
eye, he wondered why he had been such a blind fool.
Never had the singing to these dances seemed so
absurd.</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">"Hawk hop out and the crow hop in,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">Three hands round and go it ag&#39;in.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">Allemane left, back to the missus,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">Grande right and left and sneak a few kisses."</p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">He rushed from the room and down to the stable.
At sight of him some one leaped on a horse and rode
out into the darkness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Who was that?" asked Texas of a man lounging
by the corral.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That was—" and he gave the name of the loose-lipped
man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Texas cursed long and picturesquely. Then he
went back to the bunk-room and tried to pick a
<span class="tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span>
<a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
quarrel with Peter Hamilton, who good-naturedly
assumed that his old friend had been drinking and
refused to take offence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter went in to ask Kitty to dance with him.
All that evening he had been waiting anxiously for
Judith. Meanwhile he had used all his influence as
a newly appointed member of the Wetmore outfit
to soothe the ruffled feelings of the cattle-men.
Of the tragedy in the valley he had heard no
rumor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Kitty had come to the point where she was willing
to waive the Récamier-Chateaubriand friendship
in favor of one more personal and ordinary.
In fact, as Peter showed a disposition to regard as
final her answer to him on the day he had spurred
across the desert, Kitty, with true feminine perversity,
inclined to permit him to resume his suit.
His acquiescence in her refusal she had at first
regarded as the turning of the worm; after the wolf-hunt,
however, her meditations were more disturbing.
She had never told Peter of that strange
woodland meeting with Judith, yet Judith&#39;s beauty,
her probable hold over Peter, the degree of his
affection for her were rankling questions in Kitty&#39;s
consciousness. In the stress of these considerations
Kitty lost her head completely for so old a campaigner.
She drew the apron-string tight—attempted
force instead of strategy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Kitty and Peter finished their waltz, one of the
few round dances of the evening.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"How perfectly you dance, Kitty! It&#39;s a long
time since we&#39;ve had a waltz together."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span>
<a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">The cow-punchers looked at Kitty as if she were
not quite flesh and blood. Such flaxen daintiness,
femininty etherealized to angelic perfection, was new
to them, but their admiration was like that given to
a delicate exotic which, wonderful as it is, one is
well pleased to view through the glass of the florist&#39;s
window.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter was deferentially attentive and zealous to
make the Wetmore party have a thoroughly good
time, yet he did all these things, as it were, with
his eye on the door. He was not obviously distrait;
he was the man of the world, talking, making himself
agreeable, "doing his duty," while his subconsciousness
was busy with other matters. It was
rather through telepathy than through any lack
of attention paid to her that Kitty realized the
state of things, and in proportion to her realization
came a feeling of helplessness; it was so new, so
unexpected, so cruel. He seemed drifting away
from her on some tide of affairs of the very existence
of which she had been unconscious. Further and
further he had drifted, till intelligible speech no
longer seemed possible between them. They said
the foolish, empty things that people call out as the
boat glides away from the shore, the things that
all the world may hear, and in his eyes there was
only that smiling kindness. How had it come about
after all these years? What was it that had first
cut the cable that sent him drifting? What was it?
She must think. Oh, who could think with that
noise! How silly was their singing as they danced,
how uncouth!</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span>
<a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">"All dance as pretty as you can,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">Turn your toes and left alleman;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8em" class="tei tei-l">First gent sashay to the right,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">Now swing the girl you last swung about,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">And now the one that&#39;s cut her out,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 8em" class="tei tei-l">And now the one that&#39;s dressed in white,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em" class="tei tei-l">And now the belle of the ball."</p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">The dancers seemed bitten to the quick with the
tarantula of an ecstatic hilarity; their bodies swayed
in perfect harmony to the swing of the fiddles
and the swell of the chorus. The most uncouth
of them came under the spell of that mad magic.
Their movements, that in the beginning of the
dance had been shy and awkward, became almost
beautiful; they forgot arms, hands, feet; their bodies
had become like the strings of some skilfully played
instrument, obediently responsive to rhythm,
and in that composite blending of races each in his
dancing brought some of the poetry of his own far
land. The scene was amazing in its beauty and
simplicity, like the strong, inspirational power and
rugged rhythm of some old border minstrel. One
by one the dancers glowed with better understanding;
discordant elements, alien nations were
fused to harmony in this vivid picture.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter turned to Kitty, expecting to see her face
aglow with the warmth of it. She stood beside
him, the one unresponsive soul in the room, on her
lips a pale, tolerant smile.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Aren&#39;t they splendid, Kitty, these women?
More than half of them work like beavers all day,
and they have young children and dozens of worries,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span>
<a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but would you suspect it? They&#39;re just the women
for this country."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Now in the present state of affairs almost any
other subject would have been better calculated
to promote good feeling than the one on which
Peter had alighted. Kitty&#39;s thoughts had perversely
lingered about one who, though not one with these
women, had yet their sturdy self-reliance, their
acquiescence in grim conditions, their pleasure in
simple things. Kitty&#39;s apprehension, slow to kindle,
had taken fire like a forest, and by its blaze she saw
things in a distorted light; her present vision
magnified the relations of Peter and Judith to a
degree that a month ago she would have regarded
as impossible. "He is her lover!" was the accusation
that suddenly flashed through her mind, and
with the thought an overwhelming desire to say
something unkind, something that should hurt him,
supplanted all judgment and reason.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, it&#39;s a decidedly remarkable scene, pictorially,
I agree with you. And an artist, of course—but
isn&#39;t it a trifle quixotic, Peter, to idealize them because
they are having a good time? There&#39;s no
virtue in it. It is conceivable that they might
have to work just as hard and have just as many
little children to look after, and yet not have these
dances you praise them for coming to."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I&#39;m afraid you find us and our amusements a
little crude. Evidently the spirit of our dances
does not appeal to you; but I did not suppose it
necessary to remind you that they should not
be judged by the standard of conventional evening
<span class="tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span>
<a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
parties," said Peter, hurt and angry in his
turn.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Us, our amusements, our dances? So you are
quite identified with these people, my dear Peter,
and I had thought you an ornament of cotillions and
country clubs. I can only infer that it is somebody
in particular who has brought about your
change of heart."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter flushed a little, and Kitty kept on: "Some
of the native belles are quite wonderful, I believe.
Nannie Wetmore tells of a half-breed who is very
handsome."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter set his lips. "At the expense of spoiling
Nannie&#39;s pretty romance, I must tell you that the
lady she refers to is not only the most beautiful of
women, but she would be at ease in any drawing-room.
It would be as ridiculous to apply the petty
standards of ladyhood to her as it would to—well,
imagine some foolish girl bringing up the question at
a woman&#39;s club—&#39;Was Joan of Arc a lady?&#39;" Peter
spoke without calculating the conviction that his
words carried. He was angry, and his manner,
voice, intonation showed it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Kitty, now that her most unworthy suspicions
had been confirmed by Peter&#39;s ardent championing
of Judith, lost her discretion in the pang that
gnawed her little soul: "I beg your pardon, Peter.
When I spoke I did not, of course, know that this
young woman was anything to you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Anything to me? My dear Kitty, I&#39;ve never
had a better friend than Judith Rodney."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The dance was at its flood-tide. The exhilaration
<span class="tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span>
<a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had grown with each sweep of the fiddle-bow, with
the sorcery of sinuous, swaying bodies, with the song
of the dancers as they joined in the calling out of the
figures, with the rhythmic shuffle of feet, with the
hum of the pulses, with the leaping of blood to
cheek and heart till the dancers whirled as leaves
circling towards the eddies of a whirlpool. The
dancing Mrs. Dax split her favors into infinitesimal
fragments, for each measure of which her long list of
waiting gallants stood ready to pick a quarrel if
need be. Her dancing, in the splendor of its
spontaneity, had something of the surge of the west
wind sweeping over a field of grain. Sometimes
she waved back her partner and alone danced a
figure, putting to the music her own interpretation—barbaric,
passionate, rude, but magnificently vivid.
And the dancers would stop and crowd about her,
clapping hands and stamping feet to the rhyming
movement of her body, while against the wall her
hostile sister-in-law, Mrs. Leander, stood and glared
in a fury of disapproval, Leander himself smiling
broadly meanwhile and exercising the utmost restraint
to keep from joining Mrs. Johnnie&#39;s train.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The "XXX" men, who had remained aloof from
the dancers and the merriment, keeping a faithful
vigil in the bunk-room, where the hospitable bottles
were to be found, seemed to awaken from the spell
that had bound them all day. Henderson, the
foreman, whose face had not lost its tallow paleness
despite the number of his potations, put his head
through the door to have a look at the dancing Mrs.
Dax, was caught in the outermost eddy of the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span>
<a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whirling throng, and was soon dancing as madly as
the others. The rest of the "XXX" party still
hugged the bunk-room, where the bottles gleamed
hospitable. They were still dusty from their long
ride of the early morning, and more than once their
fear-quickened imaginations had been haunted by
the spectre of the dead cotton-woods, from which
something heavy and limp and warm had been
swaying when they left it. Henderson had secured
the dancing Mrs. Dax for a partner. The "caller-out,"
stationed between the two rooms, warmed to
his genial task. He improvised, he put a wealth
of imagination and personality into his work, he
showered compliments on the nimbleness of Mrs.
Dax&#39;s feet, he joked Henderson on his pallor, he
attempted a florid venture at Kitty. Miguel put
fresh magic into his bowing, José&#39;s fiddle rioted with
the madness of it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith stood for a moment in the kindly enveloping
darkness, and her heart cried out in protest at
the thing she must do. It was the utmost cruelty
of fate that forced her here to dance on the evening
of the day that they had killed him. But she must
do it, that his children might evade the stigma of
"cattle-thief," that the shadow of the gallows-tree
might not fall across their young lives, that the
neighbors might give credence to the tale of Jim&#39;s
escape from his enemies, that Alida and she might
earn the pittance that would give the children the
"clean start" that Jim had set his heart on so
confidently. And she must dance and be the
merriest of them all that these things might happen,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span>
<a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but again and again she deferred the dread moment.
The light, the music, the voices, the shuffle of the
feet came to her as she stood forlorn in the grateful
darkness. On the wall the shadows of the dancers,
magnified and grotesque, parodied their movements,
as they contended there, monstrous, uncouth shapes,
like prehistoric monsters gripping, clinching in some
mighty struggle; and above it all sang out the wild
rhythm of Miguel&#39;s fiddle, and young José&#39;s bow
capered madly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith drew close to the window, and the merriment
struck chill at her heart like the tolling of a
knell. She saw the pale face of Henderson gleam
yellow-white among the dancers, and, watching him,
the blood-lust of the Indian woke in her heart.
The rest of the room was but a blur; the dancers
faded into swaying shadows; she saw nothing but
Henderson as he danced that he might forget the
gray of morning, the black, dead trees, and the
grotesque thing with head awry that swayed in the
breeze like a pendulum. He dreaded the long, black
ride that would bring him to his camp, for he alone
of the lynchers remained. Something was drawing
his gaze out into the blackness of the night. He
struggled against the temptation to look towards
the window. He whirled the Dax woman till her
twinkling feet cleared the floor. He sang to the
accompaniment of Miguel&#39;s fiddle. He was outwitting
the thing that dangled before his eyes,
having the incontrovertible last word with a vengeance.
And as he danced and swayed, all unwittingly
his glance fell on the window opposite,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span>
<a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Jim Rodney&#39;s face looked in at him, beautiful
in its ecstasy of hate—Rodney&#39;s face, refined,
sharpened, tried in some bitter crucible, but
Rodney&#39;s face! Henderson could not withdraw his
fascinated gaze. He stood in the midst of the
dancers like a man turned to stone. He put up his
hand to his eyes as if to brush away a cloud of
swarming gnats, then threw up his arms and rushed
from the room. The dancers paused in their mad
whirl. Miguel&#39;s bow stopped with a wailing shriek.
Every eye turned towards the window for an explanation
of Henderson&#39;s sudden panic, but all
was dark without on the prairie. The magic had
gone from the dance, the whirlwind of drapery that
had swung like flags in a breeze dropped in dead
air. "What was it?" the dancers asked one another
in whispers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And for answer Judith entered, but a Judith
that was strange to them. There was about her a
white radiance that kept the dancers back, and in
her eyes something of Mary&#39;s look, as she turned
from Calvary. The dancers still kept the position
of the figures, the men with their arms about their
partners&#39; waists, the women stepping forward; they
were like the painted figures of dancers in a fresco.
And among them stood Judith, waiting to play her
part, waiting to show her world that she could
dance and be merry because all was well with her
and hers. But the bronzed sons of the saddle hung
back, they who a day before would have quarrelled
for the honor of a dance. They were afraid of her;
it would be like dancing with the death angel.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span>
<a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
She looked from face to face. Surely some one
would ask her to dance, and her eyes fell on Henderson,
returning from the bottled courage in the
bunk-room. Some word was due from him to
explain his terror of a moment ago.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Oh, Miss Judith, I thought you was a ghost
when I seen you at the window."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"A ghost that&#39;s ready to dance." She held out
her hand to him. In her gesture there was something
of royal command, and Henderson, reading
the meaning in her eyes, stepped forward. Her
face, almost a perfect replica of the dead man&#39;s,
looked at him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I bring you greeting from my brother," she said.
"He has gone on a long journey."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Henderson started. Through the still room ran
the murmur, "Rodney&#39;s outwitted them; he&#39;s
played a joke on the rope!" And Judith, his dare-devil
sister, had come with his greetings to Henderson,
leader of the faction against him! The
tide had turned. The applause that is ever the
meed of the winner was hers to command. The
cattle faction were ready to sing the praises of her
splendid audacity. In their hearts they were glad
in the thought that Jim had outwitted them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Miguel&#39;s bow dashed across the strings, and he
drew from the little brown fiddle music that again
made them merry and glowing. The magic came
back to the dance, the blood leaped again with
the merry madness, and they swept to the bowing
like leaves when the first faint wail of winter cries
in the trees.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span>
<a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">Hamilton, standing apart with Kitty Colebrooke,
had been a dazed witness of the scene. With the
rest he had watched the entrance of Judith, had
been stunned by the change in her appearance, had
seen her triumph and heard the rumor of Jim&#39;s
escape, and his heart had warmed with the good
word. She had probably managed the plan, and
had come to-night, in the joy of her triumph, to hurl
in their faces that she had outwitted them. And
she had paid the penalty of her courage—her face
told that. What a woman she was! Her heart
would pay the penalty to the last throb, and yet she
could dance with the merriest of them. And as she
danced she seemed to Peter Hamilton, in her white
draperies, like a cloud of whirling snow-flakes drifting
across the silence of the desert night. She was
the one woman in all the world for him, though his
blind eyes had faced the light for years and had not
known it. He had squandered the strength of his
youth in the pursuit of a little wax light, and had
not marked the serene shining of the moon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"And a man there was and he made his prayer—"
he quoted to himself. Well, thank God that it had
not been answered. He would take her away from
here. She could take her place in his family and
reflect credit on his choice. His family, his friends—he
winced at the thought of their possible reception
of the news. But Judith&#39;s presence would
adjust these difficulties. He would present her to
Kitty now, that his old friend might see what
manner of woman she was. Kitty, he felt, would
be kind in memory of the old days. She would
<span class="tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span>
<a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
give to them both in friendship what she had
denied him in love. And as he warmed to the
thought he turned to the woman of his youth.
And she read a look in his face that had not been
there in a long time. Had he, then, come back to
her? Was the distance from bark to shore lessening
as the sea of misunderstanding diminished?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Kitty, we were speaking a moment ago of Miss
Rodney. You would like to know her, I&#39;m sure.
We&#39;ve been such good friends all these years while
you were deciding that what I wanted was not
good for us—and deciding wisely, as I know now.
Look at her! You&#39;ll understand how she has helped
me keep the balance of things. When she&#39;s finished
dancing you&#39;ll let me bring her to you, won&#39;t you?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">And Kitty, who had expected much different words,
struggled with the meaning of these unexpected
ones. The strangeness of the pain bewildered her.
Her dazed consciousness refused to accept that Peter
was asking permission to present to her a woman
whom she thought should not have been permitted
to enter her presence. There was about her a white
flame of anger that seemed to lick up the red blood
in her veins as she turned to answer:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"She is undeniably handsome, Peter, but I do
not care to meet your mistress."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He bowed low to her as Lieutenant Swift, of Fort
Washakie, who was of the Wetmore party, came to
claim Kitty&#39;s hand for the next dance. Judith and
Henderson were leading the last figure, their hands
clasped high in an arch through which the dancers
trooped in couples. Again and again he tried to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span>
<a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
catch Judith&#39;s eye, but her glance never once met
his. Her great, wide eyes had a far-away look as
if they saw some tragedy, the shadow of which
would never fall from her. She was, indeed, the
tragic muse in her floating white drapery, the
tragic muse whose grief is too deep for tears. He
watched her as she swept towards him in the figure
of the dance, the head thrown back, slightly foreshortened,
the mouth smiling with the smile that
knows all things, the eyes holy wells of truth. He
saw in her something of the tenderness of Eve, for
all the blending of the calm modern woman, capable
in affairs, equal to emergency. It was like her to
contrive her brother&#39;s escape and then to dance with
the very men who had knotted the noose for his
hanging. Henderson was bowing to her, the dance
was over, and the next moment she was alone.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Is it you, Peter?" She thrust a strand of hair
back from her temple. Her eyes rested on him for
a moment, then wandered, till in their absent look
was the rapt expression of the sleep-walker. The
dark-rimmed eyes had in their depths the quiet of a
conflagration, and Peter, seeing these things, and
knowing the gamut of all her moods, saw that he
had been mistaken. She had not come, to dance in
triumph, in the face of her brother&#39;s enemies. There
was no triumph in her face, but white, consuming
despair.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Did you ask me to dance?" Again she put back
the strand of hair. "Forgive me for being so
stupid, but I&#39;ve kept post-office to-day, and had a
long ride, and I danced with Henderson."</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span>
<a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">He drew her arm within his and led the way out
through the crowd of dancers to the star-strewn night.
She did not speak again, nor did she seem to notice
that they had left the room with the dancers. She
turned her face towards the lonely valley, where the
drama of her brother&#39;s passing had been consummated,
and something there was in her look as it
turned towards the hills that told Peter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Tell me, Judith, &#39;what has happened?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For answer she pointed towards the valley. "They
did it last night at the dead cotton-woods. Henderson
led them. I could not stay with Alida.
I had to come here to dance that no one might
suspect."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Her voice was steady, but low and thrilling.
In its deep resonance was the echo of all human
sorrow. There was no hint of accusation, yet Peter
felt accused. He felt, now when it was too late,
that his position had been one of almost pusillanimous
negligence. From the beginning he had taken
a firm stand against violent measures. He had
talked, argued, reasoned, inveighed against violence;
no later than a week ago he had ridden across the
desert to tell Henderson that the Wetmore outfit
would take no part in violence of any sort, and that
the cattle outfit that did resort to extreme measures
would miss the support of the "W-Square" in any
future range business. But it had not been enough.
He should have made plain his position in regard to
Judith. With her as his future wife the tragedy
of the valley would not have been possible.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">From the ranch-house came the swell of the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span>
<a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fiddles, the rhythmic shuffle of feet, the song of the
dancers, dulled by distance. Beside him was Judith,
a white spirit, the woman in her dead of grief. And
yet, through all the grim horror of the tragedy she
remembered the part that had been allotted to her,
threw all the weight of her personality on the side
of the game she was playing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You must be on our side, Peter, and when there
is talk of Jim&#39;s absence you must imply that he is
East somewhere. You will know how to meet such
inquiries better than we women. Henderson will
be only too glad. You should have seen the wretch
when I held out my hand to him and told him to
dance with me. He came, white and shambling;
we have nothing to fear from Henderson. Alida
has no money to go away with. She and I must
stay here and make a beginning for the children,
and, Peter, we want you to help us."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He had no voice to answer her brave words for a
minute, and then his sentences came uncertain and
halting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You must think me a poor sort of friend, Judith,
one who has been blind till the eleventh hour and
is then found wanting. I feel so guilty to you, to
your brother&#39;s wife, to that little child who put out
his arms so trustfully to me that night, but I never
imagined that things would come to such a pass as
this. The smaller cattle outfits have been doing a
good deal of blustering, but the more conservative
element supposed that they had them in check, and
did not for a moment think that they would take
the law into their own hands. Believe me, this lawlessness
<span class="tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span>
<a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
has been in the face of every influence
that could be brought to bear, and it shall not go
unpunished."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She spoke to him from the darkness, as the spirit
of grief might speak. "An eye for an eye, a tooth
for a tooth, that is the justice of the plains. But,
Peter, it is but poor justice. What&#39;s done is done,
and fresh violence will not give back Alida her
husband nor the little ones their father. What we
need is friends, one or two loyal souls who, though
knowing the hideous truth of this thing, will stand
by us in our pitiful falsehood. I have told no one,
nor shall I, but you and—Peter, you must not laugh
at your fellow-conspirator—Leander."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He took her hands in his and pressed them; big
hands they were, and hardened by many a homely
task, but withal tender and with the healing quality
of womanliness in the touch of their warm, supple
fingers. But to-night she did not seem to know that
he held them, nor to be conscious of his presence.
The woman in her was dead of grief. The white
spirit in her place, that plotted and planned that
Jim&#39;s children and Jim&#39;s wife might not from henceforth
walk in the shadow of the gallows, was beyond
the prompting of the flesh. And again she spoke
to him in the same far-away voice, with the same
far-away look in her eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You must know, Peter, that Leander is at heart
of the salt of the earth. I told him about it all, and
he asked to be given the commission to deal with the
men. He has risen to his post magnificently. I
heard him swear the wretches to secrecy, hint to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span>
<a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them that he had a great story to tell them. They
were frightened, and listened. And the poor little
man that we have so despised told them convincingly
how Jim had made good his escape—even Henderson
half believes we saved him."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Peter hoped that she would accuse him of his half-heartedness
indirectly, if not openly. It would
have made his conscience more comfortable, and his
conscience troubled him sorely to-night. It was
that fatal habit of procrastination that had brought
this thing about. He had hesitated all these weeks
about Judith, and while he had threshed out the
pro and con of her disadvantageous family connection,
this hideous tragedy had happened.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Peter"—and now her eyes seemed to come back
to earth again, to lose something of the far-away look
of the sleep-walker—"Peter, I&#39;m cruel to speak to
you of these things now. When your heart is full
of your own happiness, I come to you like a dark
shadow with this tragedy. But I am glad for the
good that has come to you, Peter. Perhaps Miss
Colebrooke told you of the day I met her in the
wood, the day of the wolf-hunt. She was so
beautiful, I understood—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Judith, I hardly know how to say what I am
going to, I feel that I have been such a bad friend
to you, but you must hear me patiently. Together,
if you are willing, after knowing all of me that you
do, we must look after your brother&#39;s children.
That night in the little house in the valley, when
the little chap came to me, don&#39;t you remember,
there was something fine and fearless in the way
<span class="tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span>
<a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he did it. &#39;You may belong to the cattle side of
the argument,&#39; he seemed to say, &#39;but I trust you.&#39;
Now, Judith dear, that boy&#39;s faith in me is not
going to be shaken. We must look after them
together. It is a very little thing you have asked
of me, my dearest, but a very big one that I am
asking of you. Do you understand, my Judith,
it is <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">you</span> that I want? Don&#39;t think of me as I have
been, Judith, but as you are going to make me. I
want you to give me the right now, this evening,
to share all this trouble with you. Do we understand
each other, Judith? Is it to be? And
will you come back with me now, into the room
where they are dancing, and let me present you to
them, to the Wetmores, as <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">my</span> Judith, my betrothed?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But, Peter, I don&#39;t understand. I—I thought
you and Miss Colebrooke were—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"That&#39;s all over, Judith. I did love her once.
Oh, you dear, brave woman, I&#39;m not a hero from any
point of view, and you know it. It&#39;s but a sorry
lover that&#39;s making his prayer to you, my dearest;
but you won&#39;t judge, I know, beloved, you will
love me instead?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith turned towards the valley. Her whole
being throbbed with a passionate response to the
man who stood so humbly before her, but there
were duties that came first. Her mind was full of
Alida and her children, and her eyes still sought
Peter&#39;s imploringly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"You will be a good friend to them, Peter—to
Jim&#39;s people? I cannot talk to you of anything
<span class="tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span>
<a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
else to-night. Your heart is big, Peter, but you
cannot feel, perhaps—"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Listen, Judith. Whatever friendship and protection
I can give your family you may count
upon from now till the end of time. I will be theirs
as I am yours. I feel your grief, but I want to
soothe it, too. And if you love me, and I feel,
Judith, that you do, you must let them all see to-night,
these people who know us both, that we
stand together before all the world for better or
worse. Think, Judith, and you will see that you
owe it to yourself, to me, to all these men, who
reverence you as the one woman, the one ideal in
their lonely lives."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">She could not speak. The moment was too full,
the strain had been too great; but she smiled
surrender, and Peter caught her tenderly in his
arms and kissed her once—his Judith she was
now, his heroine. Then, without another word,
he drew her arm through his and led her back to
the lights, where the dancers still held high carnival.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith&#39;s half-sister, Eudora, was making a pretty
quarrel by perversely forgetting the order in which
she had given her dances. The girl was so undeniably
happy that Judith dreaded the grim news she
must tell her. Eudora blushed as she encountered
Judith&#39;s eye. Her half-sister ever offered a check
on Eudora&#39;s exuberant coquetry, with its precipitation
of discussions that often ended in bullets.
Leander stood on the outermost fringe of Eudora&#39;s
potential partners. He would not have dared to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span>
<a name="Pg330" id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
maintain it openly, yet he was sure the pretty minx
had promised that dance to him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Dance with Leander, dear, and don&#39;t let those
men begin quarrelling. I&#39;ve something to tell you,
presently," said Judith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Texas Tyler stood glowering at them from the
doorway. He would not catch Judith&#39;s eye as she
tried to speak to him. Kitty sat alone for the
moment. She had sent the young lieutenant to
fetch her a cup of coffee, but as Peter approached
with Judith she averted her eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Kitty, may I present to you my fiancée, Miss
Rodney?"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Kitty rose superbly to the situation. She might,
indeed, have made the match she was so overjoyed
in the good-fortune of her old friend Peter. She
made no reference to the woodland meeting—she
hoped for the happiness of seeing them in town.
And she bade Peter tell the good news to Nannie
Wetmore, they would be so glad. Nannie swallowed
a grimace and proffered a cousinly hand. She
had suspected some such news as this when she saw
that things were not going well with Kitty and
Peter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Better one dance with a good partner that can
swing ye than several with a feeble partner that
leaves ye to swing your own corners!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Judith looked up, smiling. She recognized the
characteristic utterance of her old friend Mrs.
Yellett. The matriarch had sustained a breakdown,
and arrived, in consequence, when the dance was
half over, but she was philosophical, as always, in
<span class="tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span>
<a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the face of misfortune, and loudly attested her
pleasure in the renowned pedal feats of her partner,
Costigan.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Behind came Mary Carmichael, looking brown
and happy. From the attitude of the group around
Judith and Peter Mary divined what had happened,
and came to add her congratulations. Even Mrs.
Yellett forgot to choose an axiom as her medium
of expression, and kissed Judith publicly, with
affectionate unction. Henderson had effaced himself,
and Leander, proud of his triumph and Judith&#39;s
commendation, sat in a corner and smiled contentedly.
Ignorant of the drama to which they had
played chorus, the dancers still riotously swung one
another up and down the length of the room, and
from the little brown fiddles came the gay music
of Judith&#39;s betrothal.</p>

support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number
of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in
machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment

particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
IRS.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND

approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

<p class="tei tei-p"><span class="tei tei-name">Professor Michael S. Hart</span> is the
originator of the Project Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that
could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
support.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook&#39;s
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph">editions</em> of our eBooks replace the old file
and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file
is renamed. <em class="tei tei-emph">Versions</em> based on separate sources are treated
as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: </p><blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-q"><p class="tei tei-p"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org" class="tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="tei tei-p">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;, including how to
make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and
how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
